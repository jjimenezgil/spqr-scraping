				Before, O conscript fathers, I say those things concerning the republic which I
                    think myself bound to say at the present time, I will explain to you briefly the
                    cause of my departure from, and of my return to the city. When I hoped that the
                    republic was at last recalled to a proper respect for your wisdom and for your
                    authority, I thought that it became me to remain in a sort of sentinelship,
                    which was imposed upon me by my position as a senator and a man of consular
                    rank. Nor did I depart anywhere, nor did I ever take my eyes off from the
                    republic, from the day on which we were summoned to meet in the temple of
                    Tellus; , in which temple, I, as far as was in my power, laid
                    the foundations of peace, and renewed the ancient precedent set by the
                    Athenians; I even used the Greek word,,which that city employed in those times in allaying discords, and gave my
                    vote that all recollection of the existing dissensions ought to be effaced by
                    everlasting oblivion. , "," This meeting took place on the third day after
                        Caesar's death.,

M. Tullius Cicero,Divination,section 1,"There is an ancient belief, handed down to us
even from mythical times and firmly established by
the general agreement of the Roman people and of all
nations, that divination of some kind exists among
men; this the Greeks call ,—that is, the
foresight and knowledge of future events. A really
splendid and helpful thing it is—if only such a faculty
exists—since by its means men may approach very
near to the power of gods. And, just as we Romans
have done many other things better than the Greeks,
so have we excelled them in giving to this most
extraordinary gift a name, which we have derived
from , a word meaning “gods,” whereas, according to Plato's interpretation, they have derived it

M. Tullius Cicero,De Officiis,section 1," ,  My dear son Marcus, you have now been studying , a full year under Cratippus, and that too in
Athens, and you should be fully equipped with the
practical precepts and the principles of philosophy; so
much at least one might expect from the pre-eminence not only of your teacher but also of the city;
the former is able to enrich you with learning, the
latter to supply you with models. Nevertheless, just
as I for my own improvement have always combined
Greek and Latin studies—and I have done this not
only in the study of philosophy but also in the practice of oratory—so I recommend that you should do
the same, so that you may have equal command of
both languages. And it is in this very direction that
I have, if I mistake not, rendered a great service
to our countrymen, so that not only those who are
unacquainted with Greek literature but even the
cultured consider that they have gained much both
in oratorical power and in mental training.,
, ", Introduction: the importance of combining Greek and Latin studies.
Celsus,De Medicina,Prooemium,"
				 Just as agriculture promises nourishment to healthy bodies, so does the Art of Medicine promise health to the sick. Nowhere is this Art wanting, for the most uncivilized nations have had knowledge of herbs, and other things to hand for the aiding of wounds and diseases. This Art, however, has been cultivated among the Greeks much more than in other nations — not, however, even among them from their first beginnings, but only for a few generations before ours. Hence Aesculapius is celebrated as the most ancient authority, and because he cultivated this science, as yet rude and vulgar, with a little more than common refinement, he was numbered among the gods. After him his two sons, Podalirius and Machaon, who followed Agamemnon as leader to the Trojan War, gave no inconsiderable help to their comrades. Homer stated, however, not that they gave any aid in the pestilence or in the various sorts of diseases, but only that they relieved wounds by the knife and by medicaments. Hence it appears that by them those parts only of the Art were attempted, and that they were the oldest.,  From the same authority, indeed, it can be learned that diseases were then ascribed to the anger of the immortal gods, and from them help used to be sought; and it is probable that with no aids against bad health, none the less health was generally good because of good habits, which neither indolence nor luxury had vitiated: since it is these two which have afflicted the bodies of men, first in Greece, and later amongst us; and hence this complex Art of Medicine, not needed in former times, nor among other nations even now, scarcely protracts the lives of a few of us to the verge of old age.,
				Therefore even after these I have mentioned, no distinguished men practised the Art of Medicine until literary studies began to be pursued with more attention, which more than anything else are a necessity for the spirit, but at the same time are bad for the body. At first the science of healing was held to be part of philosophy, so that treatment of disease and contemplation of the nature of things began through the same authorities; clearly because healing was needed especially by those whose bodily strength had been weakened by restless thinking and night-watching. Hence we find that many who professed philosophy became expert in medicine, the most celebrated being Pythagoras, Empedocles and Democritus. But it was, as some believe, a pupil of the last, Hippocrates of Cos, a man first and foremost worthy to be remembered, notable both for professional skill and for eloquence, who separated this branch of learning from the study of philosophy. After him,  Diocles of Carystus, next Praxagoras and Chrysippus, then Herophilus and Erasistratus, so practised this art that they made advances even towards various methods of treatment.,
				 During the same times the Art of Medicine was divided into three parts: one being that which cures through diet, another through medicaments, and the third by hand. The Greeks termed the first ,, the second ,, the third ,. But of that part which cured diseases by diet those who were by far the most famous authorities, endeavouring to go more deeply into things, claimed for themselves also a knowledge of nature, without which it seemed that the Art of Medicine would be stunted and weak. After them first of all Serapion, declaring that this kind of reasoning method was in no way pertinent to Medicine, based it only upon practice and upon experience. To him followed Apollonius and Glaucias, and somewhat later Heraclides of Tarentum, and other men of no small note, who in accordance with what they professed called themselves Empirici (or Experimentalists). Thus this Art of Medicine which treats by diet was also divided into two parts, some claiming an Art based upon speculation, others on practice alone. But after those mentioned above no one troubled about anything except what tradition had handed down to him until Asclepiades changed in large measure the way of curing. Of his successors, Themison, late in life, diverged from Asclepiades in some respects. And it is through these men in particular that this health-giving profession of ours has grown up.,
				 Since of the divisions of the Art of Medicine, the,  one which heals diseases, as it is the most difficult, is also the most famous, we must speak about it first. And because there is a primary difference of opinion, so holding that the sole knowledge necessary is derived from experience, others propounding that practice is not efficient enough except after acquiring a reasoned knowledge of human bodies and of nature, I must indicate which are the principal statements on either side, so that I may the more easily interpose my own opinion also.,
				 They, then, who profess a reasoned theory of medicine propound as requisites, first, a knowledge of  hidden causes involving diseases, next, of  evident causes, after these of  natural actions  also, and lastly of  the internal parts.,
				 They term hidden, the causes concerning which inquiry is made into the principles composing our bodies, what makes for and what against health. For they believe it impossible for one who is ignorant of the origin of diseases to learn how to treat them suitably. They say that it does not admit of doubt that there is need for differences in treatment, if, as certain of the professors of philosophy have stated, some excess, or some deficiency, among the four elements, creates adverse health; or, if all the fault is in the humours, as was the view of Herophilus; or in the breath, according to Hippocrates; or if blood is transfused into those blood-vessels which are fitted for pneuma, and excites inflammation,  which the Greeks term  ,, and that inflammation effects such a disturbance as there is in fever, which was taught by Erasistratus; or if little bodies by being brought to a standstill in passing through invisible pores block the passage, as Asclepiades contended — his will be the right way of treatment, who has not failed to see the primary origin of the cause. They do not deny that experience is also necessary; but they say it is impossible to arrive at what should be done unless through some course of reasoning. For the older men, they say, did not cram the sick anyhow, but reasoned out what might be especially suitable, and then put to the test of experience what conjecture of a sort had previously led up to. Again they say that it makes no matter whether by now most remedies have been well explored already . . . if, nevertheless, they started from a reasoned theory; and that in fact this has also been done in many instances. Frequently, too, novel classes of disease occur about which hitherto practice has disclosed nothing, and so it is necessary to consider how such have commenced, without which no one among mortals can possibly find out whether this rather than that remedy should be used; this is the reason why they investigate the occult causes.,
				 But they call evident those causes, concerning which they inquire, as to whether heat or cold, hunger or surfeit, or such like, has brought about the commencement of the disease; for they say that he will be the one to counter the malady who is not ignorant of its origin.,
				 Further, they term natural actions of the body, those by which we draw in and emit breath, take in,  and digest food and drink, as also those actions through which food and drink are distributed into every part of the members. Moreover, they also inquire why our blood-vessels now subside, now swell up; what is the explanation of sleep and wakefulness: for without knowledge of these they hold that no one can encounter or remedy the diseases which spring up in connexion with them. Among these natural actions digestion seems of most importance, so they give it their chief attention. Some following Erasistratus hold that in the belly the food is ground up; others, following Plistonicus, a pupil of Praxagoras, that it putrefies; others believe with Hippocrates, that food is cooked up by heat. In addition there are the followers of Asclepiades, who propound that all such notions are vain and superfluous, that there is no concoction at all, but that material is transmitted through the body, crude as swallowed. And on these points there is little agreement indeed among them; but what does follow is that a different food is to be given to patients according as this or that view is true. For if it is ground up inside, that food should be selected which can be ground up the most readily; if it putrefies, that which does so most expeditiously; if heat concocts it, that which most excites heat. But none of these points need be inquired into if there be no concoction but such things be taken which persist most in the state in which they were when swallowed. In the same way, when breathing is laboured, when sleep or wakefulness disturbs, they deem him able to remedy it who had understood beforehand how these same natural actions happen.,
				 Moreover, as pains, and also various kinds of  ,diseases, arise in the more internal parts, they hold that no one can apply remedies for these who is ignorant about the parts themselves; hence it becomes necessary to lay open the bodies of the dead and to scrutinize their viscera and intestines. They hold that Herophilus did this in the best way by far, when they laid open men whilst alive — criminals received out of prison from the kings — and while these were still breathing, observed parts which beforehand nature had concealed, their position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, relation, processes and depressions of each, and whether any part is inserted into or is received into another. For when pain occurs internally, neither is it possible for one to learn what hurts the patient, unless he had acquainted himself with the position of each organ or intestine; nor can a diseased portion of the body be treated by one who does not know what that portion is. When a man's viscera are exposed in a wound, he who is ignorant of the colour of a part in health may be unable to recognize which part is intact, and which part damaged; thus he cannot even relieve the damaged part. External remedies too can be applied more aptly by one acquainted with the position, shape and size of the internal organs, and like reasonings hold good in all the instances mentioned above. Nor is it, as most people say, cruel that in the execution of criminals, and but a few of them, we should seek remedies for innocent people of all future ages.,
				 On the other hand, those who are called ""Empirici"" because they have experience, do indeed accept evident causes as necessary; but they contend,  that inquiry about obscure causes and natural actions is superfluous, because nature is not to be comprehended. That nature cannot be comprehended is in fact patent, they say, from the disagreement among those who discuss such matters; for on this question there is no agreement, either among professors of philosophy or among actual medical practitioners. Why, then, should anyone believe rather in Hippocrates than in Herophilus, why in him rather than in Asclepiades? If one wants to be guided by reasoning, they go on, the reasoning of all of them can appear not improbable; if by method of treatment, all of them have restored sick folk to health: therefore one ought not to derogate from anyone's credit, either in argument or in authority. Even philosophers would have become the greatest of medical practitioners, if reasoning from theory could have made them so; as it is, they have words in plenty, and no knowledge of healing at all. They also say that the methods of practice differ according to the nature of localities, and that one method is required in Rome, another in Egypt, another in Gaul; but that if the causes which produce diseases whether everywhere the same, the same remedies should be used everywhere; that often, too, the causes are apparent, as, for example, of ophthalmia, or of wounds, yet such causes do not disclose the treatment: that if the evident cause does not supply the knowledge, much less can a cause which is in doubt yield it. Since, therefore, the cause is as uncertain as it is incomprehensible, protection is to be sought rather from the ascertained and explored, as in all the rest of the Arts, that is, from what experience has taught in the actual course of treatment: for,  even a farmer, or a pilot, is made not by disputation but by practice. That such speculations are not pertinent to the Art of Medicine may be learned from the fact that men may hold different opinions on these matters, yet conduct their patients to recovery all the same. This has happened, not because they deduced lines of healing from obscure causes, nor from the natural actions, concerning which different opinions were held, but from experiences of what had previously succeeded. Even in its beginnings, they add, the Art of Medicine was not deduced from such questionings, but from experience; for of the sick who were without doctors, some in the first days of illness, longing for food, took it forthwith; others, owing to distaste, abstained; and the illness was more alleviated in those who abstained. Again, some partook of food whilst actually under the fever, some a little before, others after its remission, and it went best with those who did so after the fever had ended; and similarly some at the beginning adopted at once a rather full diet, others a scanty one, and those were made worse who had eaten plentifully. When this and the like happened day after day, careful men noted what generally answered the better, and then began to prescribe the same for their patients. Thus sprang up the Art of Medicine, which, from the frequent recovery of some and the death of others, distinguished between the pernicious and the salutary.,
				 It was afterwards, they proceed, when the remedies had already been discovered, that men began to discuss the reasons for them: the Art of Medicine was not a discovery following upon reasoning, but after the discovery of the remedy, the reason for it was,  sought out. They ask, too, does reasoning teach the same as experience? If the same, it was needless; if something else, then it was even opposed to it: nevertheless, at first remedies had to be explored with the greatest care; now, however, they have been explored already; there were neither new sorts of diseases to be found out, nor was a novel remedy wanted. For even if there happened nowadays some unknown form of malady, nevertheless the practitioner had not to theorize over obscure matters, but straightway would see to which disease it came nearest, then would make trial of remedies similar to those which have succeeded often in a kindred affection, and so through its similarities find help; that is not to say that a practitioner had no need to take counsel, and that an irrational animal was capable of exhibiting this art, but that these conjectures about concealed matters are of no concern because it does not matter what produces the disease but what relieves it; nor does it matter how digestion takes place, but what is best digested, whether concoction comes about from this cause or that, and whether the process is concoction or merely distribution. We had no need to inquire in what way we breathe, but what relieves laboured breathing; not what may move the blood-vessels, but what the various kinds of movements signify. All this was to be learnt through experiences; and in all theorizing over a subject it is possible to argue on either side, and so cleverness and fluency may get the best of it; it is not, however, by eloquence but by remedies that diseases are treated. A man of few words who learns by practice to discern well, would make an altogether better practitioner than he who, unpractised, over-cultivates his tongue.,
				Now the matters just referred to they deem to be superfluous; but what remains, cruel as well, to cut into the belly and chest of men whilst still alive, and to impose upon the Art which presides over human safety someone's death, and that too in the most atrocious way. Especially is this true when, of things which are sought for with so much violence, some can be learnt not at all, others can be learnt even without a crime. For when the body had been laid open, colour, smoothness, softness, hardness and all similars would not be such as they were when the body was untouched; because bodies, even when uninjured yet often change in appearance, they note, from fear, pain, want of food, indigestion, weariness and a thousand other mediocre affections; it is much more likely that the more internal parts, which are far softer, and to which the very light is something novel, should under the most severe of woundings, in fact mangling, undergo changes. Nor is anything more foolish, they say, than to suppose that whatever the condition of the part of a man's body in life, it will also be the same when he is dying, nay, when he is already dead; for the belly indeed, which is of less importance, can be laid open with the man still breathing; but as soon as the knife really penetrates to the chest, by cutting through the transverse septum, a sort of membrane which divides the upper from the lower parts (the Greeks call it dia/fragma), the man loses his life at once: so it is only when the man is dead that the chest and any of the viscera come into the view of the medical murderer, and they are necessarily those of a dead, not of a living man. It follows, therefore, that the medical man just plays the cut-throat, not that he learns,  what our viscera are like when we are alive. If, however, there be anything to be observed whilst a man is still breathing, chance often presents it to the view of those treating him. For sometimes a gladiator in the arena, or a soldier in battle, or a traveller who has been set upon by robbers, is so wounded that some or other interior part is exposed in one man or another. Thus, they say, an observant practitioner learns to recognize site, position, arrangement, shape and such like, not when slaughtering, but whilst striving for health; and he learns in the course of a work of mercy, what others would come to know by means of dire cruelty. That for these reasons, since most things are altered in the dead, some hold that even the dissection of the dead is unnecessary; although not cruel, it is none the less nasty; but all that is possible to come to know in the living, the actual treatment exhibits.,
				 Since all these questions have been discussed often by practitioners, in many volumes and in large and contentious disputations, and the discussion continues, it remains to add such views as may seem nearest the truth. These are neither wholly in accord with one opinion or another, nor exceedingly at variance with both, but hold a sort of intermediate place between divers sentiments, a thing which may be observed in most controversies when men seek impartially for truth, as in the present case. For as regards the causes which either favour health or excite disease, how breath is drawn in or food distributed, not even philosophers attain to full knowledge, but seek it out by conjecture. But where there is no certain knowledge about a thing, mere opinion about it cannot find a certain remedy.,  And it is true that nothing adds more to a really rational treatment than experience. Although, therefore, many things, which are not strictly pertinent to the Arts as such, are yet helpful by stimulating the minds of those who practise them, so also this contemplation of the nature of things, although it does not make a practitioner, yet renders him more apt and perfected in the Art of Medicine. And it is probable that Hippocrates, Erasistratus and certain others, who were not content to busy themselves over fevers and ulcerations, but also to some extent searched into the nature of things, did not by this become practitioners, but by this became better practitioners. But reasoning is necessary to the Art of Medicine, not only when dealing with obscure causes, or natural actions, but often . . . for it is an art based on conjecture. However, in many cases not only does conjecture fail, but experience as well; and at times, neither fever, nor appetite, nor sleep follow their customary course. More rarely, yet now and again, a disease itself is new. That this does not happen is manifestly untrue, for in our time a lady, from whose genitals flesh had prolapsed and become gangrenous, died in the course of a few hours, whilst practitioners of the highest standing found out neither the class of malady nor a remedy. I conclude that they attempted nothing because no one was willing to risk a conjecture of his own in the case of a distinguished personage, for fear that he might seem to have killed, if he did not save her;,  yet it is probable that something might possibly have been thought of, had no such timidity prevailed, and perchance this might have been successful had one but tried it. In this sort of practice similarity is not always of service, and when it does prove serviceable, nevertheless there has been a process of reasoning, in the theorizing over similar classes of diseases and of remedies, as to which is the best remedy to use. When, therefore, such an incident occurs, the practitioner ought to arrive at something which may answer, even if perhaps not always, yet nevertheless more often than not. He will see, however, every novel plan, not from hidden things, for these are dubious and unascertainable, but from those which can be explored, that is, from evident causes. For what matters is this: whether fatigue or thirst, whether heat or cold, whether wakefulness or hunger, whether abundance in food or wine, whether intemperance in venery, has produced the disease. Nor should there be ignorance of the sick man's temperament; whether his body is rather humid or rather dry, whether his sinews are strong or weak, whether he is frequently or rarely ill; and when ill whether so severely or slightly, for a short or long while; the kind of life he has lived, laborious or quiet, accompanied by luxury or frugality. From such and similar data, one may often deduce a novel mode of treatment.,
				  None the less the foregoing statements ought not to be passed by as if they did not admit of controversy. For Erasistratus himself has affirmed that diseases were not produced by such causes, since other persons, and even the same person at different times, were not rendered feverish by them. Further,,  certain practitioners of our time, following, as they would have it appear, the authority of Themison, contend that there is no cause whatever, the knowledge of which has any bearing on treatment: they hold that it is sufficient to observe certain general characteristics of diseases; that of these there are three classes, one a constriction, another a flux, the third a mixture. For the sick at one time excrete too little, at another time too much; again, from one part too little, from another too much; and these classes of diseases are sometimes acute, sometimes chronic, at times on the increase, at times constant, at times diminishing. Once it has been recognized, then, which it is of these, if the body is constricted, it has to be relaxed; if suffering from a flux, that has to be controlled; if a mixed lesion, the more severe malady must be countered first. Moreover, there must be treatment of one kind for acute diseases, another kind for chronic ones, another for increasing, stationary, or for those already tending to recovery. They hold that the Art of Medicine consists of such observations; which they define as a sort of way, which they name ,, and maintain that medicine should examine those characteristics which diseases have in common. They do not want to be classed with reasoners from theory, nor with those who look to experience only; for in so naming themselves Methodici, they dissent from the former because they are unwilling that the Art should consist in conjecture about hidden things, and from the latter because they think that in the observation of experience there is little of an Art of Medicine.,
				 As relates to Erasistratus, in the first place the,  actual evidence is against his opinion, because seldom does a disease occur unless following upon one of these; secondly, it does not follow that what has done no harm to one patient, or to that same patient upon one occasion, may not harm another patient, or the same one at another time. For it is possible that there are certain underlying conditions in the body, whether related to infirmity, or to an actual affection of some kind, which either are not present in another person, or were not existent in that patient on another occasion, and which of themselves are not enough to constitute a disease, yet they may render the body more liable to other injurious affections. But if Erasistratus had been sufficiently versed in the study of the nature of things, as those practitioners rashly claim themselves to be, he would have known also that nothing is due to one cause alone, but that which is taken to be the cause is that which seems to have had the most influence. Indeed it is possible that when one cause acts alone, it may not disturb, yet when acting in conjunction with other causes it may produce a very great disturbance. Moreover, even Erasistratus himself, who says that fever is produced by blood transfused into the arteries, and that this happens in an over-replete body, failed to discover why, of two equally replete persons, one should lapse into disease, and the other remain free from anything dangerous; and that clearly happens every day. Hence, however true this transfusion, one can learn that it does not occur of itself when there is bodily fullness, but when there is added something else.,
				 But disciples of Themison, if they hold their , precepts to be of constant validity, are reasoners even more than anybody else; for if a man des not hold all the tenets that another reasoner approves, he does not forthwith have to assume a different name for his art, if (and this is the essential point) he does rely not only on written authority, but also upon reasoning from theory. But if, which is nearer to the truth, the Art of Medicine admits of scarcely any universal precepts, reasoners are in the same position as those who depend upon experience alone, all the more because whether the disease has braced or relaxed is what the most uninstructed can see. But if a remedy which loosens a body braced up, or tightens a loosened body, has been deduced by a reasoning from theory, the practitioner is a reasoner; if (as the man who denies himself to be a reasoner must admit) he acts from experience, he is an Empiric. Thus according to Themison, knowledge of a disease is outside the Art, and medicine is confined to practice; nor has there been added anything to what Empirics profess, but something taken away; for reasoners from theory gaze about over a multiplicity of matters, Empirics look to circumstances the most simple, and nothing more than commonplaces. For in like manner those who treat cattle and horses, since it is impossible to learn from dumb animals particulars of their complaints, depend only upon common characteristics; so also do foreigners as they are ignorant of reasoning subtleties look rather to common characteristics of disease. Again, those who take charge of large hospitals, because they cannot pay full attention to individuals, resort to these common characteristics.,  I vow, the ancients knew all this, but were not content therewith; therefore even the oldest authority, Hippocrates, said that in healing it was necessary to take note both of common and of particular characteristics. Indeed these very Methodici, even within their professed limitations, cannot be consistent; for there are divers kinds of constricting and relaxing diseases, those in which there is a flux being the more easy to observe. For it is one thing to vomit blood, another bile, another food; it is one thing to suffer from diarrhoea, another from dysentery; one thing to be relaxed through sweating, another to be wasted by consumption. Humour may break out into particular parts, such as the eyes or the ears; from a risk of this kind there is no human member free. No one of these occurrences is treated in the same way as another.,
				 Hence the Art descends straight down from a consideration of the common characteristics of a flux to the particular case. Moreover, because the same remedies do not meet with success in all, even of similar cases, additional knowledge of peculiarities in such a case is often necessary. Although certain things act upon the bowels in most cases, whether as astringents or as laxatives, yet there are to be found some in whom the same thing acts differently than it does in others. In such instances, therefore, investigation of particular characteristics is salutary, that of common characteristics the reverse. Moreover, a reckoning up of the cause often solves the malady. Thus Cassius, the most ingenious practitioner of our generation, recently dead, in a case suffering from fever and great thirst, when he learnt that the man had begun to feel oppressed after intoxication,,  administered cold water, by which draught, when by the admixture he had broken the force of the wine, he forthwith dispersed the fever by means of a sleep and a sweat. He, as a practitioner, provided an opportune remedy, not out of consideration whether the man's body was constricted or relaxed, but from what had happened beforehand to cause it. Besides, according to these very authorities there are particulars relating to locality and to season. When they are discussing what should be done by men in health, they prescribe the avoidance of cold, heat, surfeit, fatigue, venery, especially in sickly localities and seasons; in such places and seasons rest is to be taken, particularly when one feels a sense of oppression, and neither the stomach is to be disturbed by an emetic, nor the bowels by a purge. Such generalities are indeed true: none the less they descend from them to certain particular characteristics, unless they would persuade us that climate and season are to be taken into consideration by those in health but not by the sick, the very persons in whom all such observance is by so much the more necessary, the more that their weakness is liable to all attacks. Nay, even in the same patient, the particular characteristics of a disease are very various, and those who have been treated for a time in vain by the ordinary remedies have been often restored by contrary ones. And in the giving food too there are many distinctions to be noted; I will content myself with one instance. For hunger is more easily borne by an adult than by a boy, more easily in a dense than in a thin atmosphere, more easily in winter than in summer, more easily by one accustomed to a single meal than by one used in addition to one at midday,,  more easily when sedentary than when in active exercise; and often it is necessary to hurry on the meal in the case of one who is intolerant of hunger. Hence I conjecture that he who is not acquainted with the peculiar characteristics has merely to consider the general ones; and he who can become acquainted with peculiarities, whilst insistent upon them, ought not to neglect generalities as well; and consequently, presuming their state to be equal, it is more useful to have in the practitioner a friend rather than a stranger.,
				 Therefore, to return to what I myself propound, I am of opinion that the Art of Medicine ought to be rational, but to draw instruction from evident causes, all obscure ones being rejected from the practice of the Art, although not from the practitioner's study. But to lay open the bodies of men whilst still alive is as cruel as it is needless; that of the dead is a necessity for the learner, who should know positions and relations, which the dead body exhibits better than does a living and wounded man. As for the remainder, which can only be learnt from the living, actual practice will demonstrate it in the course of treating the wounded in a somewhat slower yet much milder way.,
				With these premises I will first speak of how those in health should act  (Book I), than I will pass on to what pertains to diseases  (Book II, 1‑8), and to their treatments  (Book II, 9‑33).

C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Agricola,chapter 4,"
CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and respectable colony of Forojulium.
His grandfather, by the maternal as well as the paternal line, served the office of imperial procurator, a trust of importance, which always confers the equestrian dignity.
His father, Julius Grsecinus, was a member of the Senate, distinguished by his eloquence and philosophy.
His merit gave umbrage to  Caligula. Being commanded by that emperor to undertake the prosecution of Marcus Silanus, he refused to comply, and was put to death.
Julia Procilla, Agricola's mother, was respected for the purity of her manners.
Under her care and, as it were, in her bosom, the tender mind of the son was trained to science and every liberal accomplishment.
His own ingenuous disposition guarded him against the seductions of pleasure.
To that happy temperament was added  the advantage of pursuing his studies at Marseilles, that seat of learning, where the refinements of Greece were happily blended with the sober manners of provincial economy., ",
C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Domitianus,chapter 1,"
DOMITIAN was born upon the ninth of the calends of November,
[24th October], when his father was consul elect (being to enter upon his office the month following), in the sixth region of the city, at the Pomegranate,,
in the house which he afterwards converted into a temple of the Flavian family.
He is said to have spent the time of his youth in so much want and infamy, that he had not one piece of plate belonging to him; and it is well known, that Clodius Pollio, a man of pretorian rank, against whom there is a poem of Nero's extant, entitled Luscio, kept a note in his hand-writing, which he sometimes produced, in which Domitian made an assignment with him for bad purposes.
,
In the war with Vitellius, he fled into the capital with his uncle Sabinus, and a part of the troops they had in tie city.s But the enemy breaking in, and the temple being set on fire, he hid himself all night with the sacristan; and next morning, assuming the disguise of a worshipper of Isis, and mixing with the priests of that idle superstition, he got over the Tiber,
,
with only one attendant, to
the house of a woman who was the mother of one of his school-fellows, and lurked there so close, that, though the enemy, who were at his heels, searched very strictly after him, they could not discover him.
At last, after the success of his party, appearing in public, and being unanimously saluted by the title of Caesar, he assumed the office of praetor of the City, with consular authority, but in fact had nothing but the name; for the jurisdiction he transferred to his next colleague.
He used, however his absolute power so licentiously, that even then he plainly discovered what sort of prince he was likely to prove.
Not to go into details, after he had made free with the wives of many men of distinction, he took Domitia Longina from her husband, AElias Lamia, and married her; and in one day disposed of above twenty offices in the city and provinces; upon which Vespasian said several times, ""he wondered he did not send him a successor too."", "," A. U. C. 804., A street. in the sixth region of Rome, so called, probably, from a remarkable specimen of this beautiful shrub which had made free growth on the spot., VITELLIUS, c. XV.

refuge with a client of his father's near the Velabrum.
Perhaps he found it more safe afterwards to cross the Tiber.

C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Divus Titus,chapter 1,"
TITUS, who had the same cognomen with his father, was the darling and the delight of mankind; so much did the natural genius, address, or good fortune he possessed tend to conciliate the favour of all.
This was, indeed, extremely difficult, after he became emperor, as before that time, and even during the reign of his father, he lay under public odium  and censure.
He was born upon the third of the calends of January [30th Dec.], in the year remarkable for the death of Caius,,
near the Septizonium,,
 in a mean house, and a very small and dark room, which still exists, and is shown to the curious., "," Caligula.  Titus was born A. U. C. 794; about A. D. 49., The Septizonium was a circular building of seven stories. The remains of that of Septimis Severus, which stood on the side of the Palatine Hill, remained till the time of Pope Sixtus V., who removed it, and employed thirty-eight of its columns in ornamenting the church of St. Peter.
It does not appear whether the Septizonium here mentioned as existing in the time of Titus, stood on the same spot.
"
C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Divus Vespasianus,chapter 1,"
THE empire, which had been long thrown into a disturbed and unsettled state, by the rebellion and violent death of its three last rulers, was at length restored to peace and security by the Flavian family, whose descent was indeed obscure, and which boasted no ancestral honours; but the public had no cause to regret its elevation; though it is acknowledged that Domitian met with the just reward of his avarice and cruelty.
Titus Flavius Petro, a townsman of ,,, whether a centurion or an , of Pompey's party in the civil war, is uncertain, fled out of the battle of Pharsalia and went home; where, having at last obtained his pardon and discharge, he became a collector of the money raised by public sales in the way of auction.
His son, surnamed Sabinus, was never engaged in the military service, though some say he was a centurion of the first order, and others, that whilst he held that rank, he was discharged on account of his bad state of health: this Sabinus, I say, was a republican, and received the tax of the fortieth penny in ,.
And there were remaining, at the time of the advancement of the family, several statues, which had been erected to him by
the cities of that province, with this inscription: ""To the honest Tax-farmer."",
He  afterwards turned  usurer amongst the Helvetii, and there died, leaving behind him his wife, Vespasia ,, and two sons by her; the elder of whom, Sabinus, came to be prefect of the city, and the younger, Vespasian, to be emperor.
Polla, descended of a good family, at ,,,
had for her father Vespasius Pollio, thrice appointed military tribune, and at last prefect of the camp; and her brother was a senator of praetorian dignity.
There is to this day, about six miles from ,, on the road to Spoletum, a place on the summit of a hill, called Vespasize, where are several monuments of the Vespasii, a sufficient proof of the splendour and antiquity of the family.
I will not deny that some have pretended to say.
that Petro's father was a native of Gallia Transpadana,
,
whose employment was to hire work-people who used to emigrate every year from the country of the , into that of the Sabines, to assist them in their husbandry;
,
but who settled at last in the town of ,, and there married.
But of this I have not been able to discover the least proof, upon the strictest inquiry., "," ,, the original seat of the Flavian family, was a city of the Sabines.
Its present name is ,.

C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Vitellius,chapter 1,"
VERY different accounts are given of the origin of the Vitellian family.
Some describe it as ancient and noble, others as recent and obscure, nay, extremely mean.
I am inclined to think, that these several representations have been made by the flatterers and detractors of Vitellius, after he became emperor, unless the fortunes of the family varied before.
There is extant a memoir addressed by Quintus Eulogius to Quintus Vitellius, quzestor to the Divine Augustus, in which it is said, that the Vitellii were descended from ,, king of the aborigines, and Vitellia,, who was worshipped in many places as a goddess, and that they reigned formerly over the whole of ,: that all who were left of the family removed out of the country of the Sabines to ,, and were enrolled among the patricians: that some monuments of the family continued a long time; as the Vitellian Way, reaching from the Janiculum to the sea, and likewise a colony of
that name, which, at a very remote period of time, they desired leave from the government to defend against the Aequicolae,
,
with a force raised by their own family only: also that, in the time of the war with the Samnites, some of the Vitellii who went with the troops levied for the security of ,, settled at Nuceria,
,
and their descendants, a long time afterwards, returned again to ,, and were admitted into the patrician order.
On the other hand, the generality of writers say that the founder of the family was a freedman.
Cassius Severus
,
and some others relate that he was likewise a cobbler, whose son having made a considerable fortune by agencies and dealings in confiscated property, begot, by a common strumpet, daughter of one Antiochus, a baker, a child, who afterwards became a Roman knight.

C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Otho,chapter 1,"
THE ancestors of , were originally of the town of Ferentum, of an ancient and honourable family, and, indeed, one of the most considerable in Etruria.
His grandfather, M. Salvius Otho (whose father was a Roman knight, but his mother of mean extraction, for it is not certain whether she was free-born), by the favour of Livia Augusta, in whose house he had his education, was made a senator, but never rose higher than the praetorship.
His father, Lucius Otho, was by the mother's side nobly descended, allied to several great families, and so dearly beloved by ,, and so much resembled him in his features, that most people believed , was his father.
He behaved with great strictness and severity, not only in the city offices, but in the pro-consulship of ,, and some extraordinary commands in the army.
He had the courage to punish with death some soldiers in ,, who, in the disturbance attempted by ,, upon changing their minds, had put their generals to the sword, as promoters of that insurrection against Claudius.
He ordered the execution to take place in the front of the camp,
,
and under his own eyes; though he knew they had been advanced to higher ranks in the army by Claudius, on that very account.
By this action he acquired
fame, but lessened his favour at court; which, however, he soon recovered, by discovering to Claudius a design upon his life, carried on by a Roman knight,
,
and which he had learnt from some of his slaves.
For the senate ordered a statue of him to be erected in the palace; an honour which had been conferred but upon very few before him.
And Claudius advanced him to the dignity of a patrician, commending him, at the same time, in the highest terms, and concluding with these words: "" A man, than whom I don't so much as wish to have children that should be better.""
He had two sons by a very noble woman, Albia Terentia, namely, Lucius Titianus, and a younger called Marcus, who had the same cognomen as himself.
He had also a daughter, whom he contracted to Drusus, Germanicus's son, before she was of marriageable age., "," On the esplanade, where the standards, objects of religious reverence, were planted.

THE race of the Caesars became extinct in ,; an event prognosticated by various signs, two of which were particularly significant.
Formerly, when ,, after her marriage with Augustus, was making a visit to her villa at ,,
,
an eagle flying by, let drop upon her lap a hen, with a sprig of laurel in her mouth, just as she had seized it. Livia gave orders to have the hen taken care of, and the sprig of laurel set; and the hen reared such a numerous brood of chickens, that the villa, to this day, is called the , of the Hens.
The laurel grove, flourished so much, that the Caesars procured thence the boughs and crowns they bore at their triumphs.
It was also their constant custom to plant others on the same spot, immediately after a triumph; and it was observed that, a little before the death of each prince, the tree which had been set by him died away.
But in the last year of Nero, the
whole plantation of laurels perished to the very roots, and the hens all died.
About the same time, the temple of the Caesars,
  being struck with lightning, the heads of all the statues in it fell off at once; and Augustus's sceptre was dashed from his hands., "," ,; see the note, NERO, c. xxxix.
, The conventional term for what is most commonly known as,

"
C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Nero,chapter 1,"
Two celebrated families, the Calvini and Aenobarbi, sprung from the race of the Domitii.
The AEnobarbi derive both their extraction and their cognomen from one Lucius Domitius, of whom we have this tradition: -- As he was returning out of the country to ,, he was met by two young men of a most august appearance, who desired him to announce to the senate and people a victory, of which no certain intelligence had yet reached the city.
To prove that they were more than mortals, they stroked his cheeks, and thus changed his hair, which was black, to a bright colour, resembling that of brass; which mark of distinction descended to his posterity, for they had generally red beards.
This family had the honour of seven consulships, one triumph, and two censorships; and being admitted into the patrician order, they continued the use of the same cognomen, with no other praenomina, than those of Cneius and ,.
These, however, they assumed with singular irregularity; three persons in succession sometimes adhering to one of them, and then they were changed alternately.
For the first, second, and third of the AEnobarbi had the praenomen of ,, and
again the three following, successively, that of Cneius, while those who came after were called, by turns, one, ,, and the other, Cneius.
It appears to me proper to give a short account of several of the family, to show that , so far degenerated from the noble qualities of his ancestors, that he retained only their vices; as if those alone had been transmitted to him by his descent., ",
C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Divus Claudius,chapter 1,"
, having married Augustus when she was pregnant was, within three months afterwards, delivered.
of Drusus, the father of Claudius Caesar, who had at first the praenomen of Decimus, but afterwards that of ,; and it was suspected that he was begotten in adultery byhis father-in-law.
The following verse, however, was immediately in every one's mouth:
“,”
“,”
This Drusus, during the time of his being quaestor and praetor, commanded in the Rhaetian and German wars, and was the first of all the Roman generals who navigated the Northern Ocean.,     He made likewise some prodigious trenches beyond the ,,, which to this day are called by his name.
He overthrew the enemy in several battles and drove them far back into the depths of the desert.
Nor did he desist from pursuing them, until an apparition, in the form of a barbarian woman, of more
than human size, appeared to him, and, in the Latin tongue, forbad him to proceed any further.
For these achievements he had the honour of an ovation and the triumphal ornaments.
After his praetorship, he immediately entered on the office of consul, and returning to ,, died of disease, in the summer encampment, which thence obtained the name of ""The Unlucky Camp.""
His corpse was carried to , by the principal persons of the several municipalities and colonies upon the road, being met and received by the recorders of each place, and buried in the ,.
In honour of his memory, the army erected a monument, round which the soldiers used, annually, upon a certain day, to march in solemn procession, and persons deputed from the several cities of , performed religious rites.
The senate likewise, among various other honours, decreed for him a triumphal arch of marble, with trophies, in the ,, and gave the cognomen of Germanicus to him and his posterity.
In him the civil and military virtues were equally displayed; for, besides his victories, he gained from the enemy the Spolia Opima,, and frequently marked out the German chiefs in the midst of their army, and encountered them in single combat at the utmost hazard of his life.
He likewise often declared that he would, some time or other, if possible, restore the ancient government, On this account, I suppose, some have ventured to affirm that Augustus was jealous of him
and recalled him; and because he made no haste to com ply with the order, took him off by poison.
This I mention, that I may not be guilty of any omission, more than because I think it either true or probable, since AugustuS loved him so much when living that he always, in his wills made him joint-heir with his sons, as he once declared in the senate; and upon his decease extolled him in a speech to the people, to that degree, that he prayed the gods ""to make his Caesars like him, and to grant himself as honourable an exit out of this world as they had given him.""
And not satisfied with inscribing upon his tomb an epitaph in verse composed by himself, he wrote likewise the history of his life in prose.
He had by the younger Antonia several children, but left behind him only three, namely, Germanicus, Livilla and Claudius., "," , describes Drusus as having in this voyage circumnavigated ,, and reached the Cimbrian Chersonese and the Scythian shores, reeking with constant fogs., Tacitus, Ann. xi. 8. 1, mentions this fosse, and says that Drusus sailed up the , and the ,.

GERMANICUS, the father of Caius Caesar, and son of Drusus and the younger ,, was, after his adoption by ,, his uncle, preferred to the quaestorship, five years before he had attained the legal age, and immediately upon the expiration of that office, to the consulship.,
Having been sent to the army in ,, he restored order among the legions, who, upon the news of Augustus's death, obstinately refused to acknowledge Tiberius as emperor,, and offered to place him at the head of the state.  In which affair it is difficult to say, whether his regard to filial duty, or the firmness of his resolution, was most conspicuous.
Soon afterwards he defeated the enemy, and obtained the honours of a triumph.
Being then made consul for the second time,,

C. Suetonius Tranquillus,Tiberius,chapter 1,"
The patrician family of the Claudii (for there was a
plebeian family of the same name, no way inferior to the
other either in power or dignity) came originally from
Regilli, a town of the Sabines.  They removed thence to , soon after the building of the city, with a great body of their dependants, under Titus Tatius, who reigned jointly with , in the kingdom; or, perhaps, what is related upon better authority, under Atta Claudius, the head of the family, who was admitted by the senate into the patrician order six years after the expulsion of the Tarquins.
They likewise received from  the state, lands beyond the Anio for their followers, and a burying place for themselves near the capitol.
,
After this period, in process of time, the family had the honour of twenty-eight consulships, five dictatorships, seven censorships, seven  triumphs, and  two ovations.
Their descendants were distinguished by various , and ,,

Amongst other cognomina, they assumed that of ,, which in the , language signifies strong and valiant., "," Intramural interments were prohibited at , by the laws of the Twelve Tables, notwithstanding the practice of reducing to ashes the bodies of the dead. It was only by special privilege that individuals who had deserved well of the state, and certain distinguished families were permitted to have tombs within the city.
, Among the Romans, all the descendants from one common stock were called Geniles, being of the same race or kindred, however remote. The Gens, as they termed this general relation or clanship, was subdivided into families. in Famias velStirpes; and those of the same family were called Agnat. Relations by the father's side were also

An Agnatus might also be called Cognatus, but not the contrary."

THAT the family of the Octavii was of the first distinction in ,,,

For in the most frequented part of the town, there was, not long since, a street named the Octavian; and an altar was to be seen, consecrated to one Octavius, who being chosen general in a war with some neighbouring people, the enemy making a sudden attack, while he was sacrificing to Mars, he immediately snatched the entrails of the victim from off the fire, and offered them half
raw upon the altar; after which, marching out to battle,
he returned victorious. This incident gave rise to a law,
by which it was enacted, that in all future times the entrails should be offered to Mars in the same manner; and
the rest of the victim be carried to the Octavii., "," A town in the ancient Volscian territory, now called Veletri. It

he repudiated Cossutia, who was very wealthy, although her family belonged only to the equestrian order, and to whom he had been contracted when he was a mere boy.
He then married Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna, who was four times consul; and had by her, shortly afterwards, a daughter named Julia.
Resisting all the efforts of the dictator Sylla to induce him to divorce Cornelia, he suffered the penalty of being stripped of his sacerdotal office, his wife's dowry, and his own patrimonial estates; and, being identified with the adverse faction,
,
was compelled to withdraw from ,.
After changing his place of concealment nearly every night,
,
although he was suffering from a quartan ague, and having effected his release by bribing the officers who had tracked his footsteps, he at length obtained a pardon through the intercession of the vestal virgins, and of Mamercus AEmilius and Aurelius Cotta, his near relatives.
We are assured that when Sylla, having withstood for a while the entreaties of his own best friends, persons of distinguished rank, at last yielded to their importunity, he exclaimed-either by a divine impulse, or from a shrewd conjecture: ""Your suit is granted, and you may take him among you; but know,"" he added, "" that this man, for whose safety you are so extremely anxious, will, some day or other, be the ruin of the party of the nobles, in defence of which you are leagued with me; for in this one Caesar, you will find many a Marius."", "," 
,. Romulus, the founder of ,, had the honour of an apotheosis conferred on him by the senate, under the title of Quirinus, to obviate the people's suspicion of his having been taken off by a conspiracy of the patrician order. Political circumstances again concurred with popular superstition to revive this posthumous adulation in favour of Julius Caesar, the founder of the empire, who also fell by the hands of conspirators. It is remarkable in the history of a nation so jealous of public liberty, that, in both instances, they bestowed the highest mark of human homage upon men who owed their fate to the introduction of arbitrary power.
, Pliny informs us that Caius Julius, the father of Julius Caesar, a man of praetorian rank, died suddenly at ,.

His wife was also under particular restraints, and could not be divorced. If she died, the flamen resigned his office, because there were certain sacred rites which he could not perform without her assistance. Besides other marks of distinction, he wore a purple robe called laena, and a conical mitre called apex.
, Two powerful parties were contending at , for the supremacy; Sylla being at the head of the faction of the nobles, while Marius espoused the cause of the people. Sylla suspected Julius Caesar of belonging to the Marian party, because Marius had married his aunt Julia.

was the nature and the end of rhetoric, and I proved
to the best of my ability that it was an art, that it
was useful, that it was a virtue and that its material
was all and every subject that might come up for
treatment. I shall now discuss its origin, its component parts, and the method to be adopted in handling and forming our conception of each. For most
authors of text-books have stopped short of this,

commoner of sending boys to the schools of rhetoric

twofold: the rhetoricians, more especially our own,
have abandoned certain of their duties and the
teachers of literature have undertaken tasks which
rightly belong to others. , ",

it was not yet ripe for publication. As you know I
have spent little more than two years on its composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a multitude of other affairs. These two
years have been devoted not so much to actual writing
as to the research demanded by a task to which

My mother, Thebe of the golden shield, I shall place your interests above my lack of leisure. May rocky ,, in whose praises I have poured myself out, not be indignant at me.

  What is dearer to good men than their noble parents? Yield, island of Apollo; indeed, with the help of the gods I shall accomplish the end of both graceful songs,
honoring in the dance both Phoebus with the unshorn hair, in wave-washed , with its mariners, and the sea-dividing reef of the Isthmus.
    [10]
  Since the Isthmus gave to the people of Cadmus six garlands from her games, the glory of triumph for my fatherland, where Alcmena bore her fearless
son, before whom the bold hounds of Geryon once trembled. But I, while I frame for Herodotus a prize of honor for his four-horse chariot,
    [15]
  and for managing the reins with his own hands and not another's, want to join him to the song of Castor or of Iolaus, for of all heroes they were the strongest charioteers, the one born in , and the other in ,.
And in the games they attempted the greatest number of contests, and adorned their homes with tripods
    [20]
  and caldrons and goblets of gold, tasting victorious garlands. Their excellence shines clearly, in the naked footraces and in the shield-clashing hoplite races,
and in all the deeds of their hands, in flinging the spear
    [25]
  and whenever they hurled the stone discus. For there was no pentathlon, but for each feat a separate prize was set up. Often crowning their hair with wreaths from these contests they appeared beside the streams of Dirce or near the Eurotas,

    [30]
  the son of Iphicles, who was of the same city as the race of the Sown Men, and the son of Tyndareus, dwelling among the Achaeans in his highland home of Therapne. Farewell. But I, arraying with song Poseidon and the sacred Isthmus and the shores of Onchestus, shall tell, along with the honors of this man, the very famous fortune of his father Asopodorus

    [35]
  and of his ancestral land of Orchomenus, which received him from the boundless sea when he was hard-pressed by shipwreck, in chilly misfortune. But now once more his hereditary fortune has embarked him on
    [40]
  the fair weather of the old days. And he who has suffered toils gains foresight in his mind.
If a man has devoted his whole spirit to excellence, sparing neither expense nor toils, it is right to grant the boast of manliness to those who achieve excellence, with an ungrudging
    [45]
  mind. For it is an easy gift for a skilled man to speak words of praise in recompense for labors of all kinds and thus to promote the common good.
Different wages for different deeds are sweet to men, to the shepherd and the ploughman and the bird-trapper, and the man whom the sea nourishes. Every man is intent upon keeping persistent famine from his belly.
    [50]
  But he who wins rich renown in the games or in war receives the highest gain: to be well spoken of by his fellow-citizens and by strangers, the choicest bloom of speech.
For us it is right to celebrate the earth-shaking son of Cronus, returning a good deed to our beneficent neighbor, the lord of horse-racing and chariots;
    [55]
  and to invoke your sons, Amphitryon, and the secluded valley of Minyas, and ,, the famous precinct of Demeter, and ,, when we speak of curving race-courses.
Protesilas, I add besides your sacred ground  in ,, the home of Achaean men.
    [60]
  But the brief limits of my song prevent me from telling of all the victories that Hermes, lord of games, granted to Herodotus and his horses. Truly, often that which is hushed in silence actually brings greater pleasure.
May he, raised up on the splendid wings of the Pierian Muses with their lovely voices,
    [65]
  also arm his hand with wreaths from ,, with exquisite wreaths from the Alpheus and the Olympian games, thus winning glory for seven-gated Thebes. But if someone hoards hidden wealth at home, and attacks others with mockery, he fails to consider that he is giving up his soul to Hades without glory.,

  song rushes out to give great praise for storm-footed horses, by the grace of Aetnaean Zeus. The chariot of Chromius and , urge me to harness a song of praise for deeds of victory.
The foundations of the song have been laid with the gods, and with this man's god-given excellence.
    [10]
  The summit of perfect glory is found in good fortune. The Muse loves to remember great contests. Sow some splendor on the island, which Zeus the lord of ,  gave to Persephone; he nodded assent with his flowing hair, that as the best land on the fruitful earth<


    [15]
  he would make , fertile and prosperous in her cities blossoming with wealth. And the son of Cronus sent her a people enamored of bronze-armored battle, horsemen often wedded to the golden leaves of ,'s olive. I have embarked on the occasion for many themes, without flinging a false word.
I have arrived singing of fine deeds at the courtyard gates
    [20]
  of a man who loves guests, where a beautifully arranged meal has been prepared for me, and the halls are often familiar with strangers from other lands. It is his lot to have noble friends to bring against his slanderers, like water against smoke.
    [25]
  Various men have various skills. It is right for a man to follow straight paths, and strive according to his nature.
For strength manifests itself in action, and intelligence in counsels, for those who have the inborn skill of foreseeing the future. Son of Hagesidamus, your way of life
    [30]
  grants you the enjoyment of many things. I take no pleasure in keeping great wealth hidden away in my hall, but in using what I have to be successful and to win a good name by helping my friends. For the hopes of men who toil much come to all alike.
But as for me, I cling to the theme of Heracles gladly,  rousing an ancient story from among the great heights of his excellence,
    [35]
  how, when the son of Zeus suddenly came out of his mother's womb into the brilliant light, escaping her birth-pangs, with his twin brother,
he did not escape the notice of gold-throned Hera when he was placed in his saffron swaddling-clothes. But the queen of the gods,
    [40]
  stung in  her heart, immediately sent serpents. The doors opened, and they crept into the spacious inner-chamber, eager to coil their swift jaws around the babies. But Heracles lifted his head straight up, and had his first experience of battle,
seizing
    [45]
  the two necks of the serpents in his two irresistible hands. When they were strangled, time squeezed the breath of life out of their unspeakable limbs. Unbearable fear, struck the women who were then helping Alcmena at her bedside;
    [50]
  for she herself leapt to her feet from her bed, unrobed as she was, and tried to ward off the violent attack of the monsters.
And swiftly the chiefs of the Cadmeans rushed in together in their bronze armor, and Amphitryon came brandishing a sword bared from its scabbard, stricken with sharp distress. For each man alike is oppressed by his own trouble, but the heart recovers quickly from someone else's grief.

    [55]
  He stood, possessed by overwhelming astonishment and delight. For he saw the supernatural courage and power of his son; the immortals had turned the story of the messengers to falsehood for him.
    [60]
  And he called his neighbor, the outstanding prophet of Zeus the highest, the truthful seer Teiresias. And the prophet told him and all the men what fortunes the boy would encounter:
how many he would slay on land, and how many lawless monsters at sea. And he told of a certain one,
    [65]
  most hateful, who walked with crooked insolence towards men, whom the boy would send to his doom. For he said that when the gods meet the giants in battle on the plain of Phlegra, the shining hair of the giants will be stained with dirt beneath the rushing arrows of that hero.
But he himself
    [70]
  will have allotted to him in peace, as an extraordinary reward for his great hardship, continuous peace for all time among the homes of the blessed. He will receive flourishing Hebe as his bride and celebrate the wedding-feast, and in the presence of Zeus the son of Cronus he will praise the sacred law.,

Golden lyre, rightful joint possession of Apollo and the violet-haired Muses, to which the dance-step listens, the beginning of splendid festivity; and singers obey your notes, whenever, with your quivering strings, you prepare to strike up chorus-leading preludes.
    [5]
  You quench even the warlike thunderbolt of everlasting fire. And the eagle sleeps on the scepter of Zeus, relaxing his swift wings on either side,
the king of birds; and you pour down a dark mist over his curved head, a sweet seal on his eyelids. Slumbering, he ripples his liquid back,
    [10]
  under the spell of your pulsing notes. Even powerful Ares, setting aside the rough spear-point, warms his heart in repose; your shafts charm the minds even of the gods, by virtue of the skill of Leto's son and the deep-bosomed Muses.
But those whom Zeus does not love are stunned with terror when they hear the cry of the Pierian Muses, on earth or on the irresistible sea;
    [15]
  among them is he who lies in dread Tartarus, that enemy of the gods, Typhon with his hundred heads. Once the famous Cilician cave nurtured him, but now the sea-girt cliffs above ,, and , too, lie heavy on his shaggy chest. And the pillar of the sky holds him down,
    [20]
  snow-covered Aetna, year-round nurse of bitter frost,
from whose inmost caves belch forth the purest streams of unapproachable fire. In the daytime her rivers roll out a fiery flood of smoke, while in the darkness of night the crimson flame hurls rocks down to the deep plain of the sea with a crashing roar.
    [25]
  That monster shoots up the most terrible jets of fire; it is a marvellous wonder to see, and a marvel even to hear about when men are present.
Such a creature is bound beneath the dark and leafy heights of Aetna and beneath the plain, and his bed scratches and goads the whole length of his back stretched out against it. Grant that we may be pleasing to you, Zeus,
    [30]
  you who frequent this mountain, this brow of the fruitful earth, whose namesake city near at hand was glorified by its renowned founder, when the herald at the Pythian racecourse proclaimed the name of Aetna, announcing Hieron's triumph
with  the chariot. For seafaring men, the first blessing at the outset of their voyage is a favorable wind; for then it is likely that
    [35]
  at the end as well they will win a more prosperous homecoming. And that saying, in these fortunate circumstances, brings the belief that from now on this city will be renowned for garlands and horses, and its name will be spoken amid harmonious festivities. Phoebus, lord of , and ,, you who love the Castalian spring of ,,
    [40]
  may you willingly put these wishes in your thoughts, and make this a land of fine men.
All the resources for the achievements of mortal excellence come from the gods; for being skillful, or having powerful arms, or an eloquent tongue. As for me, in my eagerness to praise that man, I hope that I may not be like one who hurls the bronze-cheeked javelin, which I brandish in my hand, outside the course,
    [45]
  but that I may make a long cast, and surpass my rivals. Would that all of time may, in this way, keep his prosperity and the gift of wealth on a straight course, and bring forgetfulness of troubles.
Indeed he might remember in what kind of battles of war he stood his ground with an enduring soul, when, by the gods' devising, they found honor such as no other Greek can pluck,
    [50]
  a proud garland of wealth. But now he has gone to battle in the manner of Philoctetes; and under compulsion even a haughty man fawned on him for his friendship. They say that the god-like heroes went to bring from , that man afflicted with a wound,
the archer son of Poeas, who sacked the city of Priam and brought an end to the toils of the Danaans;
    [55]
  he went with a weak body, but it was fated. In such a way may a god be the preserver of Hieron for the time that is still to come, giving him the opportunity for all he desires. Muse, hear me, and beside Deinomenes sing loud praises for the reward of the four-horse chariot.  The joy of his father's victory is not alien to him.
    [60]
  Come, let us devise a friendly song for the king of Aetna,
for whom Hieron founded that city with god-built freedom, in accordance with the laws of the rule of Hyllus. The descendants of Pamphylus, and, truly, of the Heracleidae also, dwelling beneath the cliffs of Taÿgetus, are willing to abide forever as Dorians under the ordinances of Aegimius.
    [65]
  Setting out from Pindus they took Amyclae and prospered, highly renowned neighbors of the Tyndaridae with their white horses, and the fame of their spear burst into bloom.
Zeus the Accomplisher, grant that beside the waters of Amenas the true report of men may always assign such good fortune to citizens and kings alike; with your blessing the man who is himself the leader,
    [70]
  and who instructs his son, may bring honor to the people and turn them towards harmonious peace. I entreat you, son of Cronus, grant that the battle-shouts of the Carthaginians and Etruscans stay quietly at home, now that they have seen their arrogance bring lamentation to their ships off ,.
Such were their sufferings, when they were conquered by the leader of the Syracusans—a fate which flung their young men from their swift ships into the sea,
    [75]
  delivering , from grievous bondage. From , I will win as my reward the gratitude of the Athenians, and in , from the battles before Cithaeron,—those battles in which the Medes with their curved bows suffered sorely; but beside the well-watered bank of the river Himeras I shall win my reward by paying my tribute of song to the sons of Deinomenes,
    [80]
  the song which they earned by their excellence, when their enemies were suffering.
If you speak in due proportion, twisting the strands of many themes into a brief compass, less blame follows from men. For wearying satiety blunts the edge of short-lived expectations, and what the citizens hear secretly weighs heavy on their spirits, especially concerning the merits of others.
    [85]
  Nevertheless, since envy is better than pity, do not abandon fine deeds! Steer your men with the rudder of justice; forge your tongue on the anvil of truth:
if even a small spark flies, it is carried along as a great thing when it comes from you. You are the guardian of an ample store. You have many faithful witnesses of both good and bad. But abide in a blossoming temper,
    [90]
  and if you are fond of always hearing sweet things spoken of you, do not be too distressed by expenses, but, like a steersman, let your sail out to the wind. Do not be deceived, my friend, by glib profit-seeking. The loud acclaim of renown that survives a man
is all that reveals the way of life of departed men to storytellers and singers alike. The kindly excellence of Croesus does not perish,
    [95]
  but Phalaris, with his pitiless mind, who burned his victims in a bronze bull, is surrounded on all sides by a hateful reputation; lyres that resound beneath the roof do not welcome him as a theme in gentle partnership with the voices of boys. The first of prizes is good fortune; the second is to be well spoken of; but a man
    [100]
  who encounters and wins both has received the highest garland.

who wields the scepter of law in , of many flocks, reaping every excellence at its peak, and is glorified

  by the choicest music, which we men often play around his hospitable table. Come, take the Dorian lyre down from its peg, if the splendor of , and of Pherenicus placed your mind under the influence of sweetest thoughts,
    [20]
  when that horse ran swiftly beside the Alpheus, not needing to be spurred on in the race, and brought victory to his master,
the king of Syracuse who delights in horses. His glory shines in the settlement of fine men founded by Lydian Pelops,
    [25]
  with whom the mighty holder of the earth Poseidon fell in love, when Clotho took him out of the pure cauldron, furnished with a gleaming ivory shoulder. Yes, there are many marvels, and yet I suppose the speech of mortals beyond the true account can be deceptive, stories adorned with embroidered lies;

    [30]
  and Grace, who fashions all gentle things for men, confers esteem and often contrives to make believable the unbelievable. But the days to come are the wisest witnesses.
    [35]
  It is seemly for a man to speak well of the gods; for the blame is less that way. Son of Tantalus, I will speak of you, contrary to earlier stories. When your father invited the gods to a very well-ordered banquet at his own dear Sipylus, in return for the meals he had enjoyed,
    [40]
  then it was that the god of the splendid trident seized you,
his mind overcome with desire, and carried you away on his team of golden horses to the highest home of widely-honored Zeus, to which at a later time Ganymede came also,
    [45]
  to perform the same service for Zeus. But when you disappeared, and people did not bring you back to  your mother, for all their searching, right away some envious neighbor whispered that they cut you limb from limb with a knife into the water's rolling boil over the fire,
    [50]
  and among the tables at the last course they divided and ate your flesh.
For me it is impossible to call one of the blessed gods a glutton. I stand back from it. Often the lot of evil-speakers is profitlessness. If indeed the watchers of , ever honored a mortal man,
    [55]
  that man was Tantalus. But he was not able to digest his great prosperity, and for his greed he gained overpowering ruin, which the Father hung over him: a mighty stone. Always longing to cast it away from his head, he wanders far from the joy of festivity.
He has this helpless life of never-ending labor,
    [60]
  a fourth toil after three others, because he stole from the gods nectar and ambrosia, with which they had made him immortal, and gave them to his drinking companions. If any man expects that what he does escapes the notice of a god, he is wrong.
    [65]
  Because of that the immortals sent the son of Tantalus back again to the swift-doomed race of men. And when he blossomed with the stature of fair youth, and down darkened his cheek, he turned his thoughts to an available marriage,

    [70]
  to win glorious Hippodameia from her father, the lord of ,. He drew near to the gray sea, alone in the darkness, and called aloud on the deep-roaring god, skilled with the trident; and the god appeared to him, close at hand.
    [75]
  Pelops said to the god, “If the loving gifts of Cyprian Aphrodite result in any gratitude, Poseidon, then restrain the bronze spear of Oenomaus, and speed me in the swiftest chariot to ,, and bring me to victory. For he has killed thirteen
    [80]
  suitors,,and postpones the marriage
of his daughter. Great danger does not take hold of a coward. Since all men are compelled to die, why should anyone sit stewing an inglorious old age in the darkness, with no share of any fine deeds? As for me, on this contest
    [85]
  I will take my stand. May you grant a welcome achievement.” So he spoke, and he did not touch on words that were unaccomplished. Honoring him, the god gave him a golden chariot, and horses with untiring wings.
He overcame the might of Oenomaus, and took the girl as his bride. She bore six sons, leaders of the people eager for excellence.
    [90]
  Now he has a share in splendid blood-sacrifices, resting beside the ford of the Alpheus, where he has his attendant tomb beside the altar that is thronged with many visitors. The fame of Pelops shines from afar in the races of the Olympic festivals,
    [95]
  where there are contests for swiftness of foot, and the bold heights of toiling strength. A victor throughout the rest of his life enjoys honeyed calm,
so far as contests can bestow it. But at any given time the glory of the present day
    [100]
  is the highest one that comes to every mortal man. I must crown that man with the horse-song in the Aeolian strain. I am convinced that there is no host in the world today who is both knowledgeable about fine things and more sovereign in power,
    [105]
  whom we shall adorn with the glorious folds of song. A god is set over your ambitions as a guardian, Hieron, and he devises with this as his concern. If he does not desert you soon, I hope that I will celebrate an even greater sweetness,

    [110]
  sped by a swift chariot, finding a helpful path of song when I come to the sunny hill of Cronus. For me the Muse tends her mightiest shaft of courage. Some men are great in one thing, others in another; but the peak of the farthest limit is for kings. Do not look beyond that!
    [115]
  May it be yours to walk on high throughout your life, and mine to associate with victors as long as I live, distinguished for my skill among Greeks everywhere.,

P. Ovidius Naso,Ars Amatoria,Book I, ," The poet here lays down the proposition of the work, which he comprehends in the two first verses: he then invokes the assistance of the gods and begins his narration., One must learn to love, and what to love: for love is so far from being forbidden, that there is nothing so commendable, provided the object is good., He speaks of love who is very seldom guided by reason., This alludes to his killing Hector, as in the , of Homer's ,., Achilles, when he was a lad, was put to this centaur to be educated., Cupid was the son of Venus, and Achilles of Thetis. Both were  children alike, and both hard to govern. For, indeed, the passions of love and glory are not easily overcome by reason, which ought always to be mistress., This he says to show us that love may also be tamed by habit. Ovid is full of these sort of similes., From whence the ancients drew their auguries. To which the poet here alludes., , names , only, of all the nine, in this place. The fable tells us, she and her sisters were born of ,'s caresses of Mnemosyne, that is, memory., It has been before observed, that , invokes the goddess of love to assist his song, , the same divinity for his world of nature, as being the mother of all generations, and all productions., The author forewarns all virgins, and chaste persons, not to follow, in all things, the precepts of his book., The poet here gives his advice as to three things: to seek after an amiable object: to win it by respect and complacency, and not to lose it after once gotten., That is, while you are a freeman, unmarried, and not engaged to any other mistress. The truest meaning that can be given, is, that while you are young, and are not yet troubled with the infirmities of age (for an old man in love is ridiculous) choose where you please., This was a shady walk which Pompey built for the people; and there were several in , of the same sort; but the most admirable one of all the porticos, was the Corinthian, near the Flaminian cirque, built by Cneius Octavius., It was the custom among the Romans, to meet in the temples of , to mourn Adonis; of which the prophet Ezekiel speaks, (,); and infamous acts of lewdness were there committed, if we may believe Juvenal in his ,., There were great numbers of the Jews at , in Augustus's reign, who were allowed full liberty to exercise their ceremonies, according to the law of ,. And the Roman ladies went often to see them out of curiosity, which gave occasion for assignations at their synagogues., That is, many women were debauched by Isis's means, as she was by , under the name of Io., The following verses are a happy paraphrase of ,; in whose time we find the long robe dealt as much with the stola, etc., as it does in our own., We see these assemblies were composed of all sorts of persons; upon which our French author remarks thus: "" This does not very well agree to the practice in our days; and I cannot comprehend how gallant women could frequent the courts of justice : where it is to be supposed, nobody came but such as had business and suits depending."", It must be owned, the theatres, amphitheatres, cirques, hippodromes, and all places where the public feasts and rejoicings were kept, were very fatal to the chastity of the women of old., This idea of the Roman theatres in their infancy, may put us in mind of our own which we read of in the old poets, in Black-friars, the Bull-and-mouth, and Barbican, not much better than the strollers at a country-fair. Yet this must be said for them: that the audience were much better treated; their fare was good, though the house was homely.  Which cannot be said of the Roman infant-stage, their wit and their theatres were alike rude; and the Shakspeares and Jonsons of , did not appear till the stage was pompous, and the scene magnificent., At which the soldiers were to fall on the women. The poet and his translators make an agreeable description of this rape. Some say there were thirty of these Sabines ravished: others, as Valerius Antius, make the number to be four hundred and twenty-seven: and Jubas, as Plutarch writes in the life of ,, swells it to six hundred., It is plain by this, the ancient Romans used to make love by signs on their fingers like the modern Spaniards and Portuguese; and this talking on the fingers is very common among us ever since Dr. Holder and Dr. Wallis taught by Mr. Popham, who was born deaf and dumb, with whom I have, however, myself held a conversation of many hours, and that many hundred times, by the help of our fingers. But the poet says there was no occasion of this dumb language at the cirque; for there was so much noise, that lovers might entertain one another as they pleased, without fear of being overheard., Young men are apt enough to do this of themselves, and need no advice; yet Juvenal, like ,, puts them in mind of it., The naval combats were represented in a place dug on purpose on the banks of the ,; it was called Naumachia;  and when occasion required the river water was let into it.  Tacitus, in his ,, makes mention of a representation of the naval battle of ,., Augustus having put an end to the war in ,, undertook an expedition into ,, and began the Parthian war;  in which he recovered the ensigns that had been taken from the Romans in the defeat of Crassus, which these verses refer to., He alludes to the triumphs of the Roman conquerors: they were wonderfully magnificent, accompanied  with rich spoils and pictures of rivers, mountains, cities, and provinces conquered by them: not to speak of the captive kings and great captains that followed the victor's car in chains: but there is so much insolence in this custom, that, with all its magnificence, we cannot in our own times relish it., The night is an ill time to choose a mistress in. We have a saying in ,, ""Women and linen look best by candle-light."", The Phrygian shepherd, to judge the beauty of these three goddesses demanded to see them naked; and the goddess were so eager to have the question decided by him, that they made no scruple to satisfy his demands., This temple was in the neighbourhood of ,, in a valley, where there is also a sacred wood. There were abundance of candles used in it, as we read in Ovid ,., The sovereign priest of Diana, Aricina, called himself king, and often got that dignity by gaining the better of his opponent in single combat., The celestial Venus is more charming than the terrestrial, and divine love soon extinguishes carnal, which burns with an obscure fire: whereas the divine enlightens those that it warms with holy desires; it leaves no string behind it and never has an end., Myrrha's love of her father Cinyras is not a fable. At least Pliny relates this adventure as a memorable story, and says Cinyras lived two hundred and ten years, and that his daughter took her mother's place, while she was busied about the sacrifices to ,.  But that her father discovering her insolence, ran after her a long time with a sword in his hand. The fable adds, she got away by favour of the night, and fled to the Sabeans, where she was changed into a tree, which bears her name. See the , of the Metamorphoses., Pasiphae, daughter of the sun, and wife to Minos king of ,, is fabled to be enamoured of a bull:  and Daedalus, the famous mechanic, assisted her to enjoy her detestable desires, by making a machine like a cow; within which she was caressed by her gallant.  From  this intrigue the Minotaur was born, half man and half bull, who was enclosed in a labyrinth, and by the assistance of Ariadne killed by Theseus., This known fable is told us thus: , falling in love with Europa daughter of Agenor, king of ,, and taking the shape of a bull, ravished her in the Dictaean cave; and begot Minos and Radamanthus. The fable of Io is this; she is said to be the daughter of Inachus debauched by , and turned into a cow ; which  jealous Juno perceiving, she begged the cow; and commanded Argos, who had a hundred eyes, to watch her; but Mercury killed her keeper by ,'s orders. Upon which Juno struck Io with madness, and she flung herself into the sea, which from her was called the Ionian, and swimming to ,, was there worshipped by the name of Isis, having first resumed her shape, and married king Osiris., Atreus's wife's name was Aeropa.  She suffered herself to be debauched by her brother-in-law, Thyestes., Her name was Scylla, and she betrayed her father, in favour of her gallant, Minos., Clytemnestra, and the adulterer Aegistheus, murdered Agamemnon: upon whose death , wrote the tragedy called Agamemnon., Phoenix the son of Amyntor, enjoyed a woman whom his father loved. His father was so enraged at him, that he imprecated all the miseries he could think of to light upon his son: whose children dying, he withdrew to Peleus, father of Achilles, who committed to him the care of his son's education., Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, was pulled to pieces by horses.   Our author in his French observations says this fable is admirably well represented in the tragedy of ,., That was a very unfortunate day for the people of ,, their army being cut in pieces by the Gauls near the river Allis, the 15th of the calends of August, in the year of the city 363., On the mistress's birthday: these presents were commonly cakes;  but we find the ladies were not satisfied with cakes only, they wanted pendants for the ears; and the way to get them is much the same in the gallant world now as in Ovid's days., There are few coquets who will lose anything for want of asking; they borrow what they never tend to restore; and this jilting humor is so livelily painted here by the poet, that one would think he had lived in another reign than that of Augustus., In this expression, which is Ovid's in the main, the Romans bore with an idea that perhaps the delicacy of the moderns will be offended with. The smell of a ram or goat is very rank, and from those animals the proverb came., Wine is favourable to lovers, inspiring them at once with boldness and vigour., Cymbals. drums, little bells, and pipes, were Bacchus and mother Cybele's consort., It was an ancient custom to sing hymns of joy at weddings; which hymns were called epithalamius, or hymeneans, from a certain Athenian named Hymen, who, as Servins reports, delivered maids from   a terrible trouble, or which they used to invoke him when they married, as the god who eased them  of the burden of their maidenheads:  le liberateur de leur virginité as my French author has it; and whether it is more a slavery or a burden, let the satirists determine., The poet's directions how the lover should behave himself at table, are very considerable in the affair he is speaking of., Spill some wine and write her name. This is not worthy the Roman elegance in all things; and, as a late commentattor observes upon this occasion they could have no tablecloths; for otherwise ,'s advice is not feasible., This and the verses that follow show that , did not mean very honestly, and the decree of the senate was obtained against him for this crime, as it is pretended, because it was strictly forbidden by the Roman laws to corrupt married women, to prevent the abuses which might happen in succession, and the injuring another man in taking from him what only belongs to himself., Eurythus, or Eurytion, was one of the centaurs at Pirithous's wedding, who got so drunk that he attempted to ravish Hippodamia, the bride; but Theseus knocked him down  with a bowl, and made him bring up his wine again with blood., Modesty is a vice, when it hinders us from doing anything that is profitable to us; and the misfortune is, it generally comes upon us most unseasonably, and when it should not. When it should, we commonly miss it; and when we do not want it, it is impertinent., He talks of modesty, and says, if the lover banishes it, he has no occasion for eloquence; for love and fortune favour the bold., Speaking of the gods, according to the stoics' opinion, which, contrary to the Epicureans, asserted that the deities concerned themselves in the affairs of this world., This is a very severe reflection on the sex, and it is hoped, whatever it might be in ,'s time, the scandal will not stick now., To their dull mates the noble ravisher.  Phoebe and , were two daughters of Leucippus, both famous for their beauty. Their father promised them  in marriage to Idas and Lynceus, but Castor and Pollux stole them away from him. Idas and Lynceus pursuing the ravishers, Caster fell by the hands  of Lynceus, and Lynceus was himself slain by Pollux: Idas running upon the latter to revenge the death of his companion, was struck to the ground thunder at Pollux feet; which , has elegantly described in his , , or Pallas was not only the goddess of arms, but of arts and manufactures. The poet means he has learnt of her enough to spin, let him now learn of her the more glorious exercise of arms., Orion fell in love with the nymph Lyrice, some name her Lynce, from a lynx, a wild beast so called, which is Merula's interpretation. But though who this Lyrice was is not very well known, yet it is not likely that Orion should be so passionately enamoured of a wild beast, and it is very probable he might be so charmed with a beautiul damsel., Patroclus, son of Menoeceus, and grandson of Actor, who having killed Clytonymus, son of Amphidamus, was banished his country, and came to Phthia, where he remained with Peleus, Achilles's father, his kinmnan.  By these means he contracted a strict friendship with Achilles, and accompanied him to the siege of ,, where he was killed., Hermione, daughter of Menelaus and Helen, who married her cousin-german, Orestes. Pylades was her husband's friend, and therefore he would not offer to corrupt his wife.  This king was the son of Strophius king of Phocis., This is one of ,'s happy ways of making use of common similes, and this and others are brought in here, to show a lover must comport himself variously, according to the various humors of women., This gives us a various idea, and livelily expresses the author's thoughts, that women are to be caught several ways., To cast anchor, as Ovid says, “,”, as one arrived at a port, where, though he is not to stay long, he intends to refresh himself."

		Athens",section 1,"At the very moment when we were supposing, men of ,, that the disasters that have befallen her have left behind them sufficient reminders to the city to prevent even our descendants from desiring a change of constitution, these men are seeking to deceive us, after our grievous sufferings and our experience of both systems, with the selfsame decrees with which they have tricked us twice before.
, ",
Lysias,Olympic Oration,section 1,"Among many noble feats, gentlemen, for which it is right to remember Heracles, we ought to recall the fact that he was the first, in his affection for the Greeks, to convene this contest.  For previously the cities regarded each other as strangers.
, ",
Lysias,Against Diogeiton,section 1,"If the matters in dispute were not important, gentlemen of the jury, I should never have allowed these persons to appear before you;  for I regard a dispute with one's relations as most disgraceful, and I know that you reprobate not merely those who are guilty of wrong, but also anyone who is unable to tolerate the sharp practice of a kinsman.  But, gentlemen, since they have been robbed of a great sum of money and, after suffering numerous outrages from those who should have been the last to act in such a way, have sought refuge in me, their brother-in-law, I find it incumbent on me to speak for them.
, ",
Lysias,Against Philon,section 1,"I did not suppose, gentlemen of the Council, that Philon would ever carry audacity to the point of consenting to appear before you in order to pass a scrutiny.  But since he is audacious, not in one instance only, but in many, and I have taken oath before entering the Council-chamber
, ",
Lysias,Against Nicomachus,section 1,"There have been cases, gentlemen of the jury, of persons who, when brought to trial, have appeared to be guilty, but who, on showing forth their ancestors' virtues and their own benefactions, have obtained your pardon.  Since, therefore, you are satisfied with the plea of the defendants, if they are shown to have done some service to the State, it is fair that you should also listen to the accusers, if they show forth a long course of villainy in the accused.
, ",
Lysias,Against Philocrates,section 1,"In this action, gentlemen of the jury, we have had more default of accusers than I expected.  There were many persons who made threats and declared that they would accuse Philocrates;  but not one of them is forthcoming at the moment.  This fact, in my opinion, is a signal proof that the terms of the writ, are correct.  For if the defendant were not in possession of a great part of Ergocles money, he would not be so successful in getting rid of his accusers.

Lysias,Against Ergocles,section 1,"The counts of the accusation are so many and so grave, men of ,, that not even were he put to death a number of times for each one of his acts would Ergocles be able, in my opinion, to give your people due satisfaction.  For it is evident that he has betrayed cities, wronged your representatives and your citizens, and advanced himself from poverty to wealth at your expense.
, ",
Lysias,Against Epicrates and his Fellow Envoys,section 1,"The accusations that have been made, men of ,, against Epicrates and his fellow-envoys are sufficient:  but you should bear in mind the assertion that you have often heard from the mouths of these men, whenever they sought to ruin somebody unjustly,—that, unless you make the convictions that they demand, your stipends will not be forthcoming.,
, "," The allusion is to the three obols paid daily to each juryman.  The expenses of the judicature were usually covered by the income from fines and confiscations, and in a time of financial stress this evil alarm might plausibly be raised.  Cf.  ,."

Well, for my part I am quite indignant that he should come before you in the confidence of this hope, as though the persons whom he had wronged were different and distinct from those who are to give their verdict on these matters, and as though it were not the same people that have been his victims and are also to be his hearers.  It is yourselves who are responsible for this:

Lysias,Defence against a Charge of subverting the Democracy,section 1,"I can find full excuse for you, gentlemen of the jury, if on hearing such statements and remembering past events you are equally incensed against all those who remained in the city.  But I am surprised at my accusers:  they neglect their own concerns to attend to those of others, and now, though they know for certain who are guilty of nothing and who have committed many offences, they seek to persuade you into holding this same opinion about us all.

Lysias,On the Refusal of a Pension,section 1,"I can almost find it in me to be grateful to my accuser, gentlemen of the Council, for having involved me in these proceedings.  For previously I had no excuse for rendering an account of my life;  but now, owing to this man, I have got one.  So I will try to show you in my speech that this man is lying, and that my own life until this day has been deserving of praise rather than envy;  for it is merely from envy, in my opinion, that he has involved me in this ordeal.

Lysias,Against Pancleon,section 1,"To speak at length upon this matter, gentlemen of the jury, is both beyond my powers and, to my mind, unnecessary;  but that I am correct in obtaining leave for my suit against this man Pancleon as being no Plataean, I will attempt to prove to you.

, "," i.e., men who, knowing the dealers were unpopular, brought charges against them hoping to be bought off.  Cf. ,, note."
Lysias,Defence against a Charge of Taking Bribes,section 1,"In regard to the counts of the accusation, gentlemen of the jury, you have been sufficiently informed;  but I must ask your attention also for what has yet to be added, so that you may understand what kind of person I am before you give your verdict upon me.  I was certified of age, in the archonship of Theopompus,:  appointed to produce tragic drama, I spent thirty minae and two months later, at the Thargelia,, two thousand drachmae, when I won a victory with a male chorus;  and in the archonship of Glaucippus,, at the Great Panathenaea, eight hundred drachmae on pyrrhic, dancers.

Lysias,For Polystratus,section 1,"In my opinion it is not the name of the Four Hundred that should incense you, but the actions of some of their number.  For there were some who had insidious designs:  but the rest were resolved to do no harm either to the city or to any amongst you;  they entered the Council-chamber with loyal thoughts, and the defendant, Polystratus, is one of that section.

Lysias,On the Property of Aristophanes,section 1,"I find myself greatly embarrassed by this trial, gentlemen of the jury, when I consider that if I fail to speak with effect today not only I but my father besides will be held to be guilty, and I shall be deprived of the whole of my possessions.  It is necessary therefore, even if I have no natural aptitude for the task, to defend my father and myself as best I can.

Lysias,"On the Confiscation of the Property of the Brother of
		Nicias",section 1,"Now you must reflect, gentlemen of the jury, on the  character that we bear as citizens ourselves, and also on the family of which we come, when we claim your pity for the wrongs that we have suffered and an award of our rights.  For we are contending, not merely for our property, but for our citizenship as well:  we must know whether we are to have our portion in the democracy of our city.  So first let me remind you of our uncle, Nicias:, ",
Lysias,On the Property of Eraton,section 1,"Perhaps some of you, gentlemen of the jury, suppose that, since I desire to be a person of some account, I must be able to excel others in speaking:  but, so far from my being competent to speak on matters that do not concern myself, I fear that, even on matters of which I am obliged to speak, I may be unable to say what is needful.  I believe, however, that if I can give you the full story of our dealings with Eraton and his children, you will easily form therefrom a proper judgement on the claim now put forward.  So let me tell it you from the beginning.
, ",
Lysias,For Mantitheus,section 1,"If I were not conscious, gentlemen of the Council, that my accusers are seeking every possible means of injuring me, I should feel most grateful to them for this accusation;  since I consider that the victims of unjust slander have the greatest service rendered to them by anyone who will compel them to undergo an examination of the record of their lives.
, ",
Lysias,Against Alcibiades 2,section 1,"I not only request you, gentlemen of the jury, to vote what is just, but I beg the generals, as they have in all else used their authority to the great advantage of the State, to be impartial also in suits for evasion of military duty, treating prosecutor and defendant alike and not to be so intent on supporting some favorite of their own as to make every endeavor that your vote shall be given against justice.

, ",
Lysias,Against Alcibiades 1,section 1,"I do not believe, gentlemen of the jury, that you desire to hear any excuse for the action of those who have resolved to accuse Alcibiades:  for from the outset he has shown himself so unworthy of the citizenship that it is the duty of anyone, even in the absence of a personal wrong suffered at his hands, to regard him none the less as an enemy because of the general tenor of his life.
, ",
Lysias,Against Agoratus,section 1,"It is the duty of you all, gentlemen of the jury, to avenge the men who were put to death as supporters of your democracy, and it is also my duty in particular; for Dionysodorus was my brother-in-law and cousin.  It happens, therefore, that I share with your democracy the same settled animosity against the defendant, Agoratus; the acts that he has committed are of a kind to give me good reason to hate him today, and justification to you for the penalty which, by Heaven's will, you are to impose on him.
, ",
Lysias,Against Eratosthenes,section 1,"The difficulty that faces me, gentlemen of the jury, is not in beginning my accusation, but in bringing my speech to an end:  so enormous, so numerous are the acts they have committed, that neither could lying avail one to accuse them of things more monstrous than the actual facts, nor with every desire to speak mere truth could one tell the whole;  of necessity either the accuser must be tired out or his time must run short.
, ",
Lysias,Against Theomnestus 2,section 1,"That he asserted that I had killed my father is in the knowledge of many of you, and they are my witnesses. But that I have not done it is evident;  for I am thirty-two years old, and this is the twentieth year since your return to the city.
, ",
Lysias,Against Theomnestus 1,section 1,"I believe that I shall not be at a loss for witnesses, gentlemen of the jury:  for I see many of you in this place of judgement who were present at the time when Lysitheus was prosecuting Theomnestus for speaking before the people, since he had lost the right to do so by having cast away his armour.  Now it was during that trial that he asserted that I had billed my own father.
, ",
Lysias,For the Soldier,section 1,"What could have been the view of my opponents in disregarding the point at issue, and in seeking to traduce my character?  Is it that they are unaware that their business is to speak on that point?  Or, though well aware of this, do they consider it will pass unobserved that they have more to state on anything than on what is their business?
, ",
Lysias,Accusation of Calumny,section 1,"It is a suitable opportunity, I consider, that I have taken to deal with matters on which I had long been wishing to speak; for we have here present the persons against whom I have to complain, and those present also before whom I am anxious to reprove the men who have done me wrong.  To be sure, one is far more earnest towards men in their presence; for although I suppose that my opponents will count it as nothing to be considered unfriendly by their friends （else they would never have made even a first attempt to offend against me）,
, ",
Lysias,On the Olive Stump,section 1,"Heretofore, gentlemen of the Council, I thought it possible for a person who so desired to avoid both law-suits and anxieties by leading a quiet life;  but now I find myself so unexpectedly embarrassed with accusations and with nefarious slanderers that, if such a thing could be, I conceive that even those who are yet unborn ought now be feeling alarmed for what is in store for them, since the conduct of these men brings as great a share of danger upon those who have done no wrong as upon those who are guilty of many offences.
, ",
Lysias,Against Andocides,section 1," ... he tied up the horse to the ring on the temple door, as though he were handing it back; but on the following night he contrived to take it away.  Well, the man who did this has perished by the most painful death, of hunger; for, although plenty of good things were set on the table before him, he found that the bread and cake had a vile odor, and he was unable to eat.
, ",
Lysias,For Callias,section 1,"If Callias had anything else than his life at stake in this trial, gentlemen of the jury, I should be content with what you have heard from the other speakers;  but, as it is, and when he urges and requests me, and he is not only a friend of mine but was one of my father's so long as he lived, and we have had many arrangements between us, I feel it would be disgraceful not to support Callias so far as justice requires and my ability permits.

, ",
Lysias,On a Wound by Premeditation,section 1,"It is surprising, gentlemen of the Council, that the fact of our reconcilement is so keenly disputed, and that, while he cannot deny his having restored the yoke of oxen, the slaves, amid all the goods on the estate that he received under the exchange,, he denies, in face of the settlement clearly made on every point, that we agreed to share the woman between us.
, "," Apparently an exchange of property in the matter of a ,.  See note on ,, and ,,. Introd."
Lysias,Against Simon,section 1,"Although I was aware of much that was outrageous about Simon, gentlemen of the Council, I did not believe that he would ever have carried audacity to the pitch of lodging a complaint as the injured party to a case where he was the person who should be punished, and of taking that great and solemn affidavit, and so coming before you.
, "," The oath or affidavit （,） taken by both parties to a suit at a private examination （,）.  See fn.  5 on ,, ,."
Lysias,Funeral Oration,section 1,"If I believed it possible, friends who are attending this burial, to set forth in speech the valor of the men who lie here, I should have reproved those who gave me but a few days' notice of having to speak over them.  But as all mankind would find all time insufficient for preparing a speech to match their deeds, the city itself therefore, as I think, taking forethought for those who speak here, makes the appointment at short notice, in the belief that on such terms they will most readily obtain indulgence from their hearers.
, ",
Lysias,On the Murder of Eratosthenes,section 1,"I should be only too pleased, sirs, to have you so disposed towards me in judging this case as you would be to yourselves, if you found yourselves in my plight.  For I am sure that, if you had the same feelings about others as about yourselves, not one of you but would be indignant at what has been done;  you would all regard the penalties appointed for those who resort to such practices as too mild.

Titus Livius (Livy),"The History of Rome, Book 45",chapter 1,"
					The heralds of victory travelled to Rome with the utmost possible speed, but on their arrival they found that the rejoicings over it had forestalled them.
						
      [,]
        Four days after the battle, while the Games were going on in the Campus Martius, a whispered rumour suddenly spread amongst the whole concourse of spectators to the effect that a battle had taken place in Macedonia resulting in the utter defeat of the king.
						
      [,]
        Then the rumour grew louder until at last cheers and applause arose as though definite tidings of victory had been brought to them. The magistrates were taken by surprise and enquired who had started this sudden outburst of joy.
						
      [,]
        As no one could be found the excitement produced by what they had taken for a certainty calmed down, but still they were convinced that it was a happy omen, which was subsequently verified by the arrival of the authentic messengers.
						
      [,]
        They were delighted quite as much at their prognostications proving true as at the victory itself.
						
      [,]
        A second outburst amongst the crowd in the Circus is recorded. On 17th September, the second day of the Roman Games, whilst the consul was mounting the stand to start the chariots, a despatch-bearer who said that he had come from Macedonia handed him a despatch wreathed in laurel.
						
      [,]
        After the chariots were started he mounted his own and, riding across the course to the raised benches where the spectators were seated, held up the laurelled despatch for the people to see. On catching sight of it, the populace, regardless of the races, ran down into the middle of the Circus.

        The consul called the senate together there and after obtaining their sanction, read the despatch to the onlookers in their seats. He announced that his colleague Lucius Aemilius had fought a decisive battle with Perseus, that the Macedonian army had been routed and cut to pieces, that the king with

        a few of his followers was a fugitive, and that all the cities of Macedonia had passed under the power of Rome.

        On hearing this, cheers and frantic applause broke out; most of the men deserted the Games and went home to carry the joyful news to their wives and children.

        This was thirteen days after the battle had been fought in Macedonia., ",

					At the beginning of the following spring, the consul Q. Marcius Philippus arrived in Brundisium with the 5000 men who were to reinforce his legions. M. Popilius, an ex-consul, and a number of young men of equally noble birth, followed the consul as military tribunes for the legions in Macedonia.
						
      [,]
        C. Marcius Figulus, who was to command the fleet, reached Brundisium at the same time, and he and the consul left Italy together.

        The following day they made Corcyra, the next day Actium, the seaport of Acarnania. The consul landed at Ambracia and proceeded by land to Thessaly. Figulus sailed past Leucatas and entered the Gulf of Corinth.

        Leaving his ship at Creusa he hurried on through the middle of Boeotia-a one day's march for a lightly-equipped soldier-to join the fleet at Chalcis. A. Hostilius was at the time in a camp near Palaepharsalus in Thessaly.

        He had not fought any important action but he had checked the licence and disorder of his soldiers and brought them up to a state of complete military efficiency, and he had been consistently honourable in his conduct towards the allies and protected them from all injustice and oppression. On hearing of the arrival of his successor he made a careful inspection of the arms, the men and the horses, and went to meet the consul with his army in complete equipment.

        Their first meeting was quite in accord with their rank and their character as Romans, and subsequently they worked in perfect harmony as long as the proconsul stayed with the army.,

       A few days later the consul addressed his troops. He first alluded to Perseus's contemplated assassination of his father, and his actual murder of his brother, and then went on to describe how, after his

      [,]
        crimes had secured him the crown, he had recourse to poisoning and bloodshed; how he laid an infamous plot against Eumenes, inflicted injuries against the people of Rome, and plundered the cities of the allies of Rome in violation of the existing treaty.

        He would find out in the ruin of his fortunes how hateful all this conduct was to the gods, for the gods bestowed their favour on natural affection and honourable dealing; it was by these that the Roman people gained their lofty position in the world.

        He next drew a comparison between the strength of Rome, embracing as she does the world, and the strength of Macedonia, army against army.

        ""How much greater,"" he exclaimed, ""were the forces of Philip and Antiochus, and yet they were shattered by armies no stronger than ours today."", ",
