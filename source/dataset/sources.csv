M. Tullius Cicero,Letters,PREFACE,"PREFACE The object of this book is to give the English-speaking public a convenient form, as faithful and readable a copy as the translator was capable of making of a document unique in the literature of antiquity. Whether we regard the orrespondence of Cicero from the point of view of the biographer and observer of character, the historian, or the lover of belles lettres, it is equally worthy of study. It seems needless to dwell on the immense historical importance of letters written by prominent actors in one of the decisive periods of the world's history, when the great Republic, that had spread its victorious arms, and its law and discipline, over the greater part of the known world, was in the throes of its change from the old order to the new. If we would understand—as who would not ?—the motives and aims of the men who acted in that great drama, there is nowhere that we can go with better hope of doing so than to these letters. To the student of character also the personality of Cicero must always have a great fascination. Statesman, orator, man of letters, father, husband, brother, and friend—in all these capacities he comes before us with singular vividness. In every one of them he will doubtless rouse different feelings in different minds. But though he will still, as he did in his lifetime, excite vehement disapproval as well as strong admiration, he will never, I think, appear to anyone dull or uninteresting. In the greater part of his letters he is not posing or assuming a character; he lets us only too frankly into his weaknesses and his vanities, as well as his generous admirations and warm affections. Whether he is weeping, or angry, or exulting, or eager for compliments, or vain of his abilities and achievements, he is not a phantasm or a farceur, but a human being with fiercely-beating pulse and hot blood. The difficulty of the task which I have been bold enough to undertake is well known to scholars, and may explain, though perhaps not excuse, the defects of my work. One who undertakes to express the thoughts of antiquity in modern idiom goes to his task with his eyes open, and has no right at every stumbling-block or pitfall to bemoan his unhappy fate. So also with the particular difficulties presented by the great founder of Latin style—his constant use of superlatives, his doubling and trebling of nearly synonymous terms, the endless shades of meaning in such common words as officium , fides , studium , humanitas , dignitas , and the like—all these the translator has to take in the day's work. Finally, there are the hard nuts to crack—often very hard—presented by corruption of the text. Such problems, though, relatively with other ancient works, not perhaps excessively numerous, are yet sufficiently numerous and sufficiently difficult. But besides these, which are the natural incidents of such work, there is the special difficulty that the letters are frequently answers to others which we do not possess, and which alone can fully explain the meaning of sentences which must remain enigmatical to us; or they refer to matters by a word or phrase of almost telegraphic abruptness, with which the recipient was well acquainted, but as to which we are reduced to guessing. When, however, all such insoluble difficulties are allowed for, which after all in absolute bulk are very small, there should (if the present version is at all worthy) be enough that is perfectly plain to everyone, and generally of the highest interest. I had no intention of writing a commentary on the language of Cicero or his correspondents, and my translation must, as a rule, be taken for the only expression of my judgment formed after reading and weighing the arguments of commentators. I meant only to add notes on persons and things enabling the reader to use the letters for biographical, social, and historical study. I should have liked to dedicate it by the words Boswellianus Boswellianis . But I found that the difficulties of the text compelled me to add a word here and there as to the solution of them which I preferred, or had myself to suggest. Such notes are very rare, and rather meant as danger signals than critical discussions. I have followed in the main the chronological arrangement of the letters adopted by Messrs. Tyrrell and Purser, to whose great work my obligations are extremely numerous. If, as is the case, I have not always been able to accept their conclusions, it is none the less true that their brilliant labours have infinitely lightened my task, and perhaps made it even possible. I ought to mention that I have adopted the English mode of dating, writing, for instance, July and August, though Cicero repudiated the former and, of course, never heard of the latter. I have also refrained generally from attempting to represent his Greek by French, partly because I fear I should have done it ill, and partly because it is not in him as in an English writer who lards his sentences with French. It is almost confined to the letters to Atticus, to whom Greek was a second mother-tongue, and often, I think, is a quotation from him. It does not really represent Cicero's ordinary style. One excuse for my boldness in venturing upon the work is the fact that no complete translation exists in English. Mr. Jeans has published a brilliant translation of a selection of some of the best of the letters. But still it is not the whole. The last century versions of Melmoth and Herbenden have many excellences; but they are not complete either (the letters to Brutus, for instance, having been discovered since), and need, at any rate, a somewhat searching revision. Besides, with many graces of style, they may perhaps prove less attractive now than they did a century ago. At any rate it is done, and I must bear with what equanimity nature has given me the strictures of critics, who doubtless will find, if so minded, many blemishes to set off against, and perhaps outweigh, any merit my translation may have. I must bear that as well as I may. But no critic can take from me the days and nights spent in close communion with Rome 's greatest intellect, or the endless pleasure of solving the perpetually recurring problem of how best to transfer a great writer's thoughts and feelings from one language to another: “ “ Caesar in hoc potuit juris habere nihil .” ”",,",PREFACE,The object of this book is to give the

                                                  language of Cicero or his correspondents, and my
                                                  translation must, as a rule, be taken for the only
                                                  expression of my judgment formed after reading and
                                                  weighing the arguments of commentators. I meant
                                                  only to add notes on persons and things enabling
                                                  the reader to use the letters for biographical,
                                                  social, and historical study. I should have liked
                                                  to dedicate it by the words,Boswellianus,,Boswellianis,. But I found
                                                  that the difficulties of the text compelled me to
                                                  add a word here and there as to the solution of
                                                  them which I preferred, or had myself to suggest.
                                                  Such notes are very rare, and rather meant as
                                                  danger signals than critical discussions. I have
                                                  followed in the main the chronological arrangement
                                                  of the letters adopted by Messrs. Tyrrell and
                                                  Purser, to whose great work my obligations are
                                                  extremely numerous. If, as is the case, I have not
                                                  always been able to accept their conclusions, it
                                                  is none the less true that their brilliant labours
                                                  have infinitely lightened my task, and perhaps
                                                  made it even possible.,I ought to mention that I have adopted the
                                                  English mode of dating, writing, for instance,
                                                  July and August, though Cicero repudiated the
                                                  former and, of course, never heard of the latter.
                                                  I have also refrained generally from attempting to
                                                  represent his Greek by French, partly because I
                                                  fear I should have done it ill, and partly because
                                                  it is not in him as in an English writer who lards
                                                  his sentences with French. It is almost confined
                                                  to the letters to Atticus, to whom Greek was a
                                                  second mother-tongue, and often, I think, is a
                                                  quotation from him. It does not really represent
                                                  Cicero's ordinary style.,One excuse for my boldness in venturing upon the
                                                  work is the fact that no complete translation
                                                  exists in English. Mr. Jeans has published a
                                                  brilliant translation of a selection of some of
                                                  the best of the letters. But still it is not the
                                                  whole. The last century versions of,Melmoth,and
                                                  Herbenden have many excellences; but they are not
                                                  complete either (the letters to Brutus, for
                                                  instance, having been discovered since), and need,
                                                  at any rate, a somewhat searching revision.
                                                  Besides, with many graces of style, they may
                                                  perhaps prove less attractive now than they did a
                                                  century ago. At any rate it is done, and I must
                                                  bear with what equanimity nature has given me the
                                                  strictures of critics, who doubtless will find, if
                                                  so minded, many blemishes to set off against, and
                                                  perhaps outweigh, any merit my translation may
                                                  have. I must bear that as well as I may. But no
                                                  critic can take from me the days and nights spent

M. Tullius Cicero,De Senectute: introduction,chapter intro,"Introduction to the Cato Maior 1. Cicero as a writer of philosophy In his youth, in preparation for a public career, Cicero devoted himself with ardour and success to the study of philosophy, and, during the whole of an exceptionally busy life, spent all his spare moments in reading and in the society of the learned. As a relaxation from public employment he produced in 55 B.C. his De oratore, in 54 his De republica and in 52 his De legibus. His choice of literature as his chief pursuit was due to political causes. In January 49 B.C., after twelve months as governor of Cilicia, Cicero returned to Italy to find his country in the midst of civil war. Long hesitating which side to embrace, he finally gave his support to Pompey. After the battle of Pharsalus, in August 48, Cicero decided that further resistance to Caesar was useless and, in October, went to Brundisium, remaining there virtually a prisoner until September 47, when Caesar granted him an unconditional pardon. Although treated by the dictator and his friends with great respect, Cicero held proudly aloof from any active participation in a government which he regarded as a tyranny. [p. 3] When, by Caesar's complete dominance of the courts and the Senate, Cicero had been excluded from those activities in which he had spent thirty brilliant and laborious years, he was forced to find some other outlet for his tireless energy of mind and body. Full of grief for the downfall of the Republic, harassed by debt and struggling under an almost intolerable weight of domestic sorrows, he turned to the writing of philosophic books as the surest relief from trouble and as the best means of serving his country. Early in 46 B.C., he withdrew from Rome to the quiet of his country places, and in that year published Paradoxa, Partitiones oratoriae, Orator, De claris oratoribus, and, probably, Hortensius. In February 45 the death of his adored and only daughter drove him into a frenzy of writing in an effort to forget his grief. In an incredibly short time he produced, in the years 45 and 44, Consolatio, De finibus, Tusculanae disputationes, De natura deorum, Cato Maior, De divinatione, De fato, De gloria, De amicitia, Topica, and De officiis. The De officiis, finished in November, closed his literary career. 2. Date of composition In a letter to Atticus written on May 11, 44 B.C. ( Ad Att. xiv. 21), Cicero speaks of the Cato Maior as then already written. In the De divinatione it is referred to as a recent work. It followed the De natura deorum which was not completed until late in August 45. While there can be no certainty as to the exact time of composition the probability is that it was written between [p. 4] December 15, 45 and January 3, 44 B.C. It was not fully revised, however, until July 17, 44 ( Ad Att. xvi. 3). 1 3. Title Cicero once refers to this essay as O Tite, si quid ( Ad Att. xiv. 11), from its initial words; once as De senectute ( De div. ii. 3), and twice as Cato Maior ( Lael. 4; Ad Att. xiv. 21). Its full title is Cato Maior de senectute. 4. Dedication to Atticus The Cato Maior and the Laelius are both dedicated to TITUS POMPONIUS ATTICUS, who was born at Rome in 109 B.C. His friendship with Cicero began in childhood and continued until Cicero's death in 43 B.C. From about 88 to 65 B.C., Atticus lived in Athens, devoting himself to the study of Greek philosophy and literature. He wrote Latin verses, which are highly commended by his biographer Cornelius Nepos, Roman Annales, a genealogical history of Roman families and a history in Greek of Cicero's consulship. He died in 32 B.C., at the age of 77, highly esteemed by the Emperor Augustus Caesar and by the leading Romans of his day. More than 400 letters from Cicero to him are extant to prove the rare intimacy and deep affection existing between these two remarkable men. [p. 5] 5. TIME OF THE DIALOGUE AND ITS INTERLOCUTORS The discussion is supposed to occur in the year 150 B.C., between Cato, then 84, Scipio, then 35, and Laelius, 2 then about 36. MARCUS PORCIUS CATO, who was born at Tusculum in 234 B.C., served under Fabius Maximus as a private soldier in the campaign against Hannibal in Campania in 214, and as a military tribune in the siege of Tarentum in 209. He was elected quaestor in 204, plebeian aedile in 199, praetor in 198, and consul in 195. In 194 he celebrated a triumph for his victories in Spain. In the war against Antiochus he was on the staff of the consul Marcus Acilius Glabrio, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Thermopylae in 191. In 184 he was censor with Flaccus and began his struggles against the lax morals of the day. He degraded seven senators, and exerted all his power to stem the tide of luxury and extravagance. Going as an envoy to Carthage in 157, he returned full of alarm at its prosperity and always thereafter, it is said, concluded every speech with the words ceterum censeo delendam esse Carthaginem. He died in 149. In addition to his ability as a farmer, soldier, statesman and orator, Cato had considerable literary talent. He published 150 speeches, a book of witticisms, a treatise entitled De re rustica, works on legal subjects and a history of Rome from its foundation to the year 150 B.C., entitled Origines. PUBLIUS SCIPIO AFRICANUS MINOR was born about 185 B.C. He was the son by birth of Lucius Aemilius [p. 6] Paulus, and the son by adoption of Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of Africanus the Elder. He was a great student and a patron of Greek and Roman letters, and numbered among his intimate friends Polybius, the Greek historian; Panaetius the Stoic, and the Roman poets Lucullus and Terence. At the age of seventeen he fought under his father Paulus at Pydna, and in 151 B.C. was military tribune in Spain. In 148, though only a candidate for the aedileship, he was elected consul. As consul a second time he destroyed Carthage in 146. Thirteen years later, in his third consulship, he captured Numantia. His death occurred in 129 and was due, it was thought, to violence. Carbo, the popular leader, was suspected of having strangled him in his bed as he slept. According to the evidence of Cicero and Polybius ( Hist. xxxii. 9–16), Scipio was one of the purest and noblest men in history. 6. Greek sources of the Cato Maior Cicero, in the letter of dedication of the Cato Maior, refers to Aristo Cius as the author of a treatise on old age, and he may have drawn upon that author in writing his own treatise. In Chapters 2 and 3 the conversation between Cephalus and Socrates in Plato's Republic is closely followed. Chapters 17 and 22 contain passages from Xenophon's Oeconomicus and Cyropaedia. In the form of the dialogue Cicero adopted the method of Aristotle rather than that of Plato, to avoid the frequent and continuous exchange of question and answer, and to permit one speaker, after a few [p. 7] remarks from the other interlocutors, to give a connected discussion. 7. Manuscripts, editions and translations The best MSS. of the Cato Maior are: P (at Paris), 9th or 10th century; L (at Leyden), 10th century; B (at Munich), 12th century; R (at Zurich), of uncertain date; E (at Berlin), 12th century; S (at Munich), 11th century. The present text is eclectic, following most closely that of J. S. Reid, but with such readings adopted from the editions of Müller, Bennett and others as seemed preferable. The critical notes of Reid and Müller and the interpretative notes of Reid and Bennett have been consulted with great profit in the preparation of the translation. For an extensive bibliography of this essay the reader is referred to the excellent edition of Frank Gardner Moore. Of the many translations consulted the best, in the opinion of the present translator, in their order of merit, are those of Shuckburgh, Edmonds, and A. P. Peabody. My grateful acknowledgements are due to Prof. bechtel of Tulane University, and to Prof. henry Strauss and Dr. J. L. Hancock of the University of Arkansas for a critical reading of the manuscript, and to my friends Mr. Brookes More of Hingham, Mass., and the late Judge Jesse Turner of Van Buren, Ark., for many helpful suggestions and criticisms.","Note: 1 That the reference in this letter is to Cato Maior and not to De gloria is clear from the context; besides, the De gloria had been sent to Atticus six days before ( Ad Att. xvi. 2).,Note: 2 For a sketch of Laelius see Lael.

full of alarm at its prosperity and always thereafter,
it is said, concluded every speech with the words,ceterum censeo delendam esse Carthaginem.,He died
in 149. In addition to his ability as a farmer,
soldier, statesman and orator, Cato had considerable literary talent. He published 150 speeches,
a book of witticisms, a treatise entitled,De re,,rustica,,works on legal subjects and a history of
Rome from its foundation to the year 150 B.C.,
entitled,Origines.,PUBLIUS SCIPIO AFRICANUS MINOR was born about
185 B.C. He was the son by birth of Lucius Aemilius,[p. 6],Paulus, and the son by adoption of Publius Cornelius
Scipio, son of Africanus the Elder. He was a great
student and a patron of Greek and Roman letters,
and numbered among his intimate friends Polybius,
the Greek historian; Panaetius the Stoic, and the
Roman poets Lucullus and Terence. At the age
of seventeen he fought under his father Paulus at
Pydna, and in 151 B.C. was military tribune in
Spain. In 148, though only a candidate for the
aedileship, he was elected consul. As consul a
second time he destroyed Carthage in 146. Thirteen
years later, in his third consulship, he captured
Numantia. His death occurred in 129 and was due,
it was thought, to violence. Carbo, the popular
leader, was suspected of having strangled him in his
bed as he slept. According to the evidence of
Cicero and Polybius (,Hist.,xxxii. 9–16), Scipio was
one of the purest and noblest men in history.,,6. Greek sources of the,Cato Maior,Cicero, in the letter of dedication of the,Cato
Maior,,refers to Aristo Cius as the author of a
treatise on old age, and he may have drawn upon
that author in writing his own treatise. In Chapters
2 and 3 the conversation between Cephalus and
Socrates in Plato's,Republic,is closely followed.
Chapters 17 and 22 contain passages from Xenophon's,Oeconomicus,and,Cyropaedia.,In the form
of the dialogue Cicero adopted the method of
Aristotle rather than that of Plato, to avoid the
frequent and continuous exchange of question and
answer, and to permit one speaker, after a few,[p. 7],remarks from the other interlocutors, to give a
connected discussion.,,7. Manuscripts, editions and translations,The best MSS. of the,Cato Maior,are: P (at
Paris), 9th or 10th century; L (at Leyden), 10th
century; B (at Munich), 12th century; R (at
Zurich), of uncertain date; E (at Berlin), 12th
century; S (at Munich), 11th century.,The present text is eclectic, following most
closely that of J. S. Reid, but with such readings
adopted from the editions of Müller, Bennett and
others as seemed preferable. The critical notes of
Reid and Müller and the interpretative notes of
Reid and Bennett have been consulted with great
profit in the preparation of the translation.,For an extensive bibliography of this essay the

M. Tullius Cicero,De Officiis: introduction and bibliography,INTRODUCTION,"INTRODUCTION IN the de Officiis we have, save for the latter Philippics, the great orator's last contribution to literature. The last, sad, troubled years of his busy life could not be given to his profession; and he turned his never-resting thoughts to the second love of his student days and n ade Greek philosophy a possibility for Roman readers. The senate had been abolished; the courts had been closed. His occupation was gone; but Cicero could not surrender himself to idleness. In those days of distraction (46–43 B.C.) he produced for publication almost as much as in all his years of active life. The liberators had been able to remove the tyrant, but they could not restore the republic. Cicero's own life was in danger from the fury of mad Antony and he left Rome about the end of March, 44 B.C. He dared not even stop permanently in any one of his various country estates, but, wretched, wandered from one of his villas to another nearly all the summer and autumn through. He would not suffer himself to become a prey to his overwhelming sorrow at the death of the republic and the final crushing of the hopes that had risen with Caesar's downfall, but worked at the highest tension on his philosophical studies. The Romans were not philosophical. In 161 B.C. the senate passed a decree excluding all philosophers [p. xii] and teachers of rhetoric from the city. They had no taste for philosophical speculation, in which the Greeks were the world's masters. They were intensely, narrowly practical. And Cicero was thoroughly Roman. As a student in a Greek university he had had to study philosophy. His mind was broad enough and his soul great enough to give him a joy in following after the mighty masters, Socrates, Plato, Zeno, Cleanthes, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and the rest. But he pursued his study of it, like a Roman, from a “practical” motive—to promote thereby his power as an orator and to augment his success and happiness in life. To him the goal of philosophy was not primarily to know but to do. Its end was to point out the course of conduct that would lead to success and happiness. The only side of philosophy, therefore, that could make much appeal to the Roman mind was ethics; pure science could have little meaning for the practical Roman; metaphysics might supplement ethics and religion, without which true happiness was felt to be impossible. Philosophical study had its place, therefore, and the most important department of philosophy was ethics. The treatise on Moral Duties has the very practical purpose of giving a practical discussion of the basic principles of Moral Duty and practical rules for personal conduct. As a philosopher, if we may so stretch the term as to include him, Cicero avows himself an adherent of the New Academy and a disciple of Carneades. He had tried Epicureanism under Phaedrus and Zeno, Stoicism under Diodotus and Posidonius; but Philo of Larissa converted him to the New Academy. Scepticism declared the attainment of absolute [p. xiii] knowledge impossible. But there is the easily obtainable golden mean of the probable; and that appealed to the practical Roman. It appealed especially to Cicero; and the same indecision that had been his bane in political life naturally led him first to scepticism, then to eclecticism, where his choice is dictated by his bias for the practical and his scepticism itself disappears from view. And while Antiochus, the eclectic Academician of Athens, and Posidonius, the eclectic Stoic of Rhodes, seem to have had the strongest influence upon him, he draws at his own discretion from the founts of Stoics, Peripatetics, and Academicians alike; he has only contempt for the Epicureans, Cynics, and Cyrenaics. But the more he studied and lived, the more of a Stoic in ethics he became. The cap-sheaf of Cicero's ethical studies is the treatise on the Moral Duties. It takes the form of a letter addressed to his son Marcus (see Index), at this time a youth of twenty-one, pursuing his university studies in the Peripatetic school of Cratippus in Athens, and sowing for what promised to be an abundant crop of wild oats. This situation gives force and definiteness to the practical tendencies of the father's ethical teachings. And yet, be it observed, that same father is not without censure for contributing to his son's extravagant and riotous living by giving him an allowance of nearly £870 a year. Our Roman makes no pretensions to originality in philosophic thinking. He is a follower—an expositor—of the Greeks. As the basis of his discussion of the Moral Duties he takes the Stoic Panaetius of Rhodes (see Index), περὶ καθήκοντος , drawing also [p. xiv] from many other sources, but following him more or less closely in Books I and II; Book III is more independent and much inferior. He is usually superficial and not always clear. He translates and paraphrases Greek philosophy, weaving in illustrations from Roman history and suggestions of Roman mould in a form intended to make it, if not popular, at least comprehensible, to the Roman mind. How well he succeeded is evidenced by the comparative receptivity of Roman soil prepared by Stoic doctrine for the teachings of Christianity. Indeed, Anthony Trollope labels our author the “Pagan Christian.” “You would fancy sometimes,” says Petrarch, “it is not a Pagan philosopher but a Christian apostle who is speaking.” No less an authority than Frederick the Great has called our book “the best work on morals that has been or can be written.” Cicero himself looked upon it as his masterpiece. It has its strength and its weakness—its sane common sense and noble patriotism, its self-conceit and partisan politics; it has the master's brilliant style, but it is full of repetitions and rhetorical flourishes, and it fails often in logical order and power; it rings true in its moral tone, but it shows in what haste and distraction it was composed; for it was not written as a contribution to close scientific thinking; it was written as a means of occupation and diversion.",,"INTRODUCTION,IN the,de Officiis,we have, save for the latter

M. Tullius Cicero,De Divinatione: introduction,"Introduction to the
        de Divinatione","Introduction to the de Divinatione 1. Date of composition This treatise was intended by Cicero to supplement his earlier work, De natura deorum, which was finished probably in August 45 B.C. The greater part of the first book of the De divinatione was written (in part at least) before the assassination of Caesar, but the work was not completed and published until after that event. 1 2. The Interlocutors The dialogue is represented as taking place between Cicero and his only brother Quintus, at Cicero's country home at Tusculum, about ten miles from Rome. [p. 215] QUINTUS CICERO was born about 102 B.C.; received instruction in the best schools at Rome and in Greece; was aedile in 65; praetor in 62; governor of Asia from March 61 to April 58; and served as legatus under Pompey in Sardinia in 56, under Caesar in Gaul in 54 and 53, and under Marcus, his brother, in Cilicia, from July 51 to July 50. In the Civil War he first joined Pompey, but, after the latter's defeat, offered his services to Caesar. Quintus was fond of reading and study and devoted much of his leisure to writing. During his stay in Gaul he wrote four tragedies, which are lost. The authorship of the Commentariolum Petitionis is generally conceded to him. He (like his brother) died in December 43, in the proscription of the Second Triumvirate. 3. Plan and sources of the dialogue In this treatise, as in his other philosophic works, Cicero draws his arguments chiefly from Greek sources, but develops them in his own inimitable way and illustrates them with examples from his varied experiences and from his vast stores of learning. As an adherent of the New Academy he was free to question the views of the other philosophic schools, to compare argument with argument, and to adopt that theory which seemed to him most consistent with reason. After a thorough and impartial study of all the extant literature on the subject, from the time of Xenophanes of Colophon, a philosopher of the Eleatic school of the sixth century B.C., to that of Cratippus of his own day, and including the teachings of the Pyth- [p. 216] agoreans, the Socratics, the Peripatetics, the Epicureans and the Stoics, he became convinced that the commonly accepted belief in divination was a superstition which “should be torn up by the roots.” He was himself an augur, and in his book On the Republic had written in favour of maintenance of the rites of augury and of auspices. But these practices were engrafted on the Roman constitution and he advocated their observance because of his belief in obedience to law and because, as a member of the aristocratic party, he thought augury and auspices the best means of controlling the excesses of democracy. 4. The argument in favour of divination In treating the subject he proceeded, not as a special pleader, but in a truly philosophic spirit. As the chief apologists for divination he selected the Stoics, who defended it with great force and plausibility, accepted it as a part of their philosophic system, and sought to bring the world into conformity with their views. They endeavoured to unite religion with philosophy to prove that the nature of the gods is adapted to reveal the divine will through divine prophecy. The belief in a superintending care of the gods seemed to them to imply a means of communication between God and man, whereby the latter might know the divine will in advance and obey it. This means they called Divination, the vis divinandi of the Romans, the μαντική of the Greeks. The arguments in the first book in favour of divination are based chiefly on the writings of [p. 217] Posidonius the Stoic. While many of the arguments in the second book go back to Carneades, the founder of the New Academy, the immediate source of the material is not Carneades himself (for he left no writings) but one of his disciples, probably Clitomachus, who was his successor in the New Academy and expounded his doctrines. The discussion of the Chaldean monstra in the second book, from sections 87 to 97, is derived from the Stoic Panaetius. The entire discussion is divided into two main parts. In the first Quintus, taking the affirmative side, sets out the reasons for his belief in divination, and in the second Marcus proceeds to overwhelm his adversary with merciless logic and, with a rare display of abounding humour and sarcasm, laughs him out of court. Quintus defines divination as “the foreknowledge and foretelling of events that happen by chance.” He divides it into two classes: the first, Artificial, which depends partly on conjecture and partly on long-continued observation, and includes astrology, auspices, augury, divining by portents, prodigies, thunder, lightning, and other natural phenomena; the second, Natural, embraces divination by means of dreams and prophecies, made by persons inspired, as seers and prophets like Calchas, Cassandra, and others, and by those in a state of ecstasy or rapture, like the Pythian priestess of Apollo, whose prophetic powers were induced by exhalations from the earth. In defence of these various kinds of divination he urged the fact of their acceptance from the earliest times by every nation, and by the greatest philosophers including Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. He was not troubled by his inability to explain the [p. 218] causes of divination. Those who denied the existence of what they could not explain and were not convinced by results and by the evidence of their own senses, for the same reason should deny the power of the magnet to attract iron, or the efficacy of drugs to effect certain cures. Divination, he urges, was established by many infallible proofs: by augury, the city of Rome had been founded and the kingdom given to Romulus; by the flight of an eagle, King Deiotarus had been warned to discontinue a journey and thereby was saved from certain death; the entrails foretold Caesar's approaching fate; in a dream the Rhodian sailor had a vision of Pompey's defeat at Pharsalus. He also does not disdain the argumentum ad hominem, but quotes freely from his brother's poetry to show that he, too, accepts divination. 2 Following the method of Posidonius, Quintus sought to bring divination into conformity with the principles of philosophy in three ways; by tracing its source to God, to nature, and to fate. The reasoning for its origin from God was borrowed from Cratippus. The human soul is an emanation from the Divine Soul which pervades and governs all things. Between the Divine Soul and the human soul, both of which are divine and eternal, there is a sympathy and a connexion which permit of communication from one to the other. The human soul when divorced from bodily influences, as in sleep and in ecstasy, is most responsive to the divine will and most endowed with divine foresight. In discussing the origin of divination from the [p. 219] second source, Quintus defines Fate or εἱμαρμένη as “the orderly succession of causes wherein cause is linked to cause and every cause has its effect.” Therefore nothing has happened which was not bound to happen and nothing will happen which will not find its efficient cause in nature. He who knows the links that join cause to cause, knows all the results of causes and can foretell every coming event. While such omniscience is possible only to God, yet since every cause has its sign and there are men who can often read those signs, in the lapse of time a science has been evolved from the recording of signs and the noting of the connexion between them and their results. The argument from nature is based on the phenomena of dreams and ecstasy. The power of the soul is much enhanced when divorced from bodily sensation. Then it sees things which are invisible to it when shackled by the flesh. During frenzy or inspiration or ecstasy nature seems most to impel the human soul to prophecy. To the objection that the forecasts of augurs, seers, soothsayers and other diviners are often erroneous, Quintus replies that the same point may be urged against experts in other arts and callings, as, for example, physicians, mariners, and statesmen. In closing Quintus makes a qualification or partial retractation by stating that he does not countenance fortune-tellers, necromancers, snake-charmers, astrologers, or interpreters of dreams who are not true diviners. [p. 220] 5. The argument against divination Marcus, in reply, first directs his attack against divination in general and adopts the reasoning of Carneades. “Divination,” he says, “has no application to things perceived by the senses, which are sufficient of themselves and require no aid from divination. Nor is there any place for it in matters within the domain of science and of art. Likewise divination has no place in resolving questions in philosophy, in dialectic or in politics. And since it is of no use in any of these cases there is no use for it anywhere.” Next, he takes the Stoic definition of divination as “the foreknowledge and foretelling of things that happen by chance,” and shows that since such things may or may not happen, or may happen in one way or another, they cannot be foreseen by any amount of reason or skill. But if it can be known in advance that an event is going to happen, then that event is certain and not subject to chance and, by the definition, is removed from the scope of divination. Furthermore, even if it was possible to know the future the disadvantages would far outweigh the gain. Cicero then takes up separately the various modes of divination under their proper divisions of Artificial and Natural and shows how utterly unreasonable they are and heaps his ridicule upon them. 6. Manuscripts, editions, and translations The best Mss. of the De divinatione are: V. Vindob., 10th century, and three Leyden Mss., A, B, and H, Leid., 12th century. The text of this edition is based chiefly on that of [p. 221] John Davies, Cambridge, 1730, but emended in many places by readings adopted from tile editions of George A. Moser, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1828, Aug. Geise, Leipsig, 1829, and C. F. W. Müller, Leipzig, 1910. Many changes have also been made in Davies' spelling, punctuation and paragraphing.

divination are based chiefly on the writings of,[p. 217],Posidonius the Stoic. While many of the arguments
in the second book go back to Carneades, the
founder of the New Academy, the immediate source
of the material is not Carneades himself (for he left
no writings) but one of his disciples, probably
Clitomachus, who was his successor in the New
Academy and expounded his doctrines. The discussion of the Chaldean,monstra,in the second book,
from sections 87 to 97, is derived from the Stoic
Panaetius. The entire discussion is divided into
two main parts. In the first Quintus, taking the
affirmative side, sets out the reasons for his belief
in divination, and in the second Marcus proceeds
to overwhelm his adversary with merciless logic
and, with a rare display of abounding humour and
sarcasm, laughs him out of court.,Quintus defines divination as “the foreknowledge
and foretelling of events that happen by chance.”
He divides it into two classes: the first, Artificial,
which depends partly on conjecture and partly on
long-continued observation, and includes astrology,
auspices, augury, divining by portents, prodigies,
thunder, lightning, and other natural phenomena;
the second, Natural, embraces divination by means
of dreams and prophecies, made by persons inspired,
as seers and prophets like Calchas, Cassandra, and
others, and by those in a state of ecstasy or rapture,
like the Pythian priestess of Apollo, whose prophetic
powers were induced by exhalations from the earth.
In defence of these various kinds of divination he
urged the fact of their acceptance from the earliest
times by every nation, and by the greatest philosophers including Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato.
He was not troubled by his inability to explain the,[p. 218],causes of divination. Those who denied the
existence of what they could not explain and were
not convinced by results and by the evidence of
their own senses, for the same reason should deny
the power of the magnet to attract iron, or the
efficacy of drugs to effect certain cures. Divination,
he urges, was established by many infallible proofs:
by augury, the city of Rome had been founded and
the kingdom given to Romulus; by the flight of
an eagle, King Deiotarus had been warned to discontinue a journey and thereby was saved from
certain death; the entrails foretold Caesar's approaching fate; in a dream the Rhodian sailor had
a vision of Pompey's defeat at Pharsalus. He also
does not disdain the,argumentum ad hominem,,but
quotes freely from his brother's poetry to show that
he, too, accepts divination.,insert_note_81,2,,Following the method of Posidonius, Quintus
sought to bring divination into conformity with the
principles of philosophy in three ways; by tracing
its source to God, to nature, and to fate. The
reasoning for its origin from God was borrowed
from Cratippus. The human soul is an emanation
from the Divine Soul which pervades and governs
all things. Between the Divine Soul and the
human soul, both of which are divine and eternal,
there is a sympathy and a connexion which permit
of communication from one to the other. The human
soul when divorced from bodily influences, as in
sleep and in ecstasy, is most responsive to the
divine will and most endowed with divine foresight.,In discussing the origin of divination from the,[p. 219],second source, Quintus defines Fate or,εἱμαρμένη,as “the orderly succession of causes wherein cause
is linked to cause and every cause has its effect.”
Therefore nothing has happened which was not
bound to happen and nothing will happen which
will not find its efficient cause in nature. He who
knows the links that join cause to cause, knows all
the results of causes and can foretell every coming
event. While such omniscience is possible only
to God, yet since every cause has its sign and there
are men who can often read those signs, in the
lapse of time a science has been evolved from the
recording of signs and the noting of the connexion
between them and their results.,The argument from nature is based on the
phenomena of dreams and ecstasy. The power of
the soul is much enhanced when divorced from
bodily sensation. Then it sees things which are
invisible to it when shackled by the flesh. During
frenzy or inspiration or ecstasy nature seems most
to impel the human soul to prophecy.,To the objection that the forecasts of augurs,
seers, soothsayers and other diviners are often
erroneous, Quintus replies that the same point
may be urged against experts in other arts and
callings, as, for example, physicians, mariners, and
statesmen.,In closing Quintus makes a qualification or partial
retractation by stating that he does not countenance
fortune-tellers, necromancers, snake-charmers, astrologers, or interpreters of dreams who are not true
diviners.,,[p. 220],,5. The argument against divination,Marcus, in reply, first directs his attack against
divination in general and adopts the reasoning of
Carneades. “Divination,” he says, “has no application to things perceived by the senses, which
are sufficient of themselves and require no aid from
divination. Nor is there any place for it in matters
within the domain of science and of art. Likewise
divination has no place in resolving questions in
philosophy, in dialectic or in politics. And since it is
of no use in any of these cases there is no use for it
anywhere.” Next, he takes the Stoic definition of
divination as “the foreknowledge and foretelling
of things that happen by chance,” and shows that
since such things may or may not happen, or may
happen in one way or another, they cannot be foreseen by any amount of reason or skill. But if it
can be known in advance that an event is going to
happen, then that event is certain and not subject
to chance and, by the definition, is removed from
the scope of divination.,Furthermore, even if it was possible to know the
future the disadvantages would far outweigh the
gain. Cicero then takes up separately the various
modes of divination under their proper divisions of
Artificial and Natural and shows how utterly unreasonable they are and heaps his ridicule upon them.,,6. Manuscripts, editions, and translations,The best Mss. of the,De divinatione,are: V. Vindob.,

M. Tullius Cicero,De Amicitia: introduction,Introduction to the Laelius,"Introduction to the Laelius 1. Date of composition Enough has been said in the introduction to the Cato Maior to show the amazing fecundity of Cicero's genius in the years 45 and 44 B.C., during which time this treatise was written. The date of its composition belongs within the year 44, but the month cannot be fixed with absolute certainty. It was written after the Cato Maior and after the completion of Divination, in which ( Div. ii. 3) Cicero gives the names of his philosophic books so far written and does not mention this work. It is referred to in the second volume of De officiis (ii. 9. 31), which was written in November. In a letter to Atticus ( Ad Att. xvi. 13 c) Cicero, on November 5, 44, asks when “Fannius, son of Marcus” (one of the interlocutors), was tribune. This inquiry suggests that he was then writing or revising the Laelius and tends to fix the date of composition in the autumn of 44 B.C. 2. Occasion of writing the Laelius It was in the year 90 B.C. that Cicero, then just sixteen, was introduced by his father to Quintus [p. 104] Mucius Scaevola the augur, to receive instruction in Roman law. While he was in constant attendance on the lectures of this learned man occurred the war of the Samnites and other Italian tribes against Rome for a larger share of Roman suffrage and in the government of the Empire. This revolution was still smouldering when in 88 B.C. Publius Sulpicius, the most powerful orator of his day, became tribune of the plebs, and proposed certain reforms which resulted in the civil war between Marius and Sulla and his own break with Pompeius Strabo. It was at this exciting time that Cicero, sitting at the feet of the aged Roman lawyer Scaevola, heard him repeat, as he tells us, the discourse of Laelius on friendship. This discourse Laelius in turn had heard from his bosom friend, Scipio Africanus the Younger. 3. Time of the dialogue and its interlocutors The time of the present dialogue is 129 B.C., just a few days after the mysterious death of Scipio Minor. The interlocutors are Laelius (who was also one of the interlocutors in the Cato Maior), and his two sons-in-law, Quintus Mucius Scaevola and Gaius Fannius. GAIUS LAELIUS, born in 186 B.C., was the son of a distinguished father of the same name who was the friend and companion of the elder Scipio Africanus. The younger Laelius became praetor in 145 B.C., and consul in 140, after his defeat in the previous year by Quintus Pompeius. He gained great credit as commander in the war against the Spanish chieftain, Viriathus. Next to Scipio, he [p. 105] was regarded as the foremost orator of his day in eloquence and purity of style. But it was as a student and man of letters that he was chiefly distinguished. His title of “the Wise” was due to his great learning and to his knowledge of philosophy. He was a pupil of Diogenes the Stoic and later, in company with Scipio, studied under Panaetius, who made his home with Scipio. Laelius was such a master of elegant diction that the plays of his poet-friend Terence, which were so much admired for the purity of their Latinity, were by many attributed in whole or in part to him. In his culture, wisdom, evenness of temper, integrity of life, keen sense of justice, and nobility of thought and speech we find ample justification for the unstinted praise accorded him by all the writers of antiquity. To the younger group of the Scipionic circle belong the other interlocutors of this essay, QUINTUS MUCIUS SCAEVOLA the augur, and GAIUS FANNIUS, son of Marcus, both sons-in-law of Laelius. Scaevola, himself a distinguished lawyer, belonged to a family of lawyers, of whom the most illustrious was his namesake and junior, the pontifex maximus. The augur was born about 157 B.C., became praetor in 121 B.C., later governor of Asia Minor, and was elected consul in 117. He lived until 88, after the overthrow of Sulpicius by Sulla. When called upon at that time to join in the decree of proscription against Marius he declared that for the sake of the few poor drops of blood in his old frame he would not consent to outlaw the man who had saved Rome and all Italy from the Gauls. He was celebrated for his wit, learning, and amiability. [p. 106] GAIUS FANNIUS STRABO, who was somewhat older than his brother-in-law, Scaevola, married the younger daughter of Laelius. He was, it is thought by Cicero ( Ad Att. xvi. 13 c), tribune of the plebs. 142 B.C.,while Publius Africanus and Lucius Mummius were censors and Lucius Caecilius Metellus and Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus were consuls. He was a writer of a Roman history, highly praised by Sallust for its accuracy, but criticized by Cicero in his Brutus as rough in style. 4. Greek sources of the Laelius The earliest known treatise in Greek on the subject of friendship is found in the Lysis of Plato, whose influence is strongly reflected in the eighth and ninth books of the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle. Many of the thoughts of this work are observed in Cicero's essay, but are not necessarily borrowed from Aristotle. In section 62 of the Laelius he draws upon Xenophon's Memorabilia, by taking the words there attributed to Socrates and placing them in the mouth of Scipio. According to Diogenes Laertius and Aulus Gellius, the chief Greek source of the present essay is a lost treatise on friendship in three volumes by Theophrastus. But in the main Cicero probably was not greatly indebted to Greek writers in the composition of this book. The arrangement, plan, style and illustrations are his own. Certainly no other author of ancient or modern times has discussed the subject of friendship with so much completeness and charm as Cicero discusses it in his Laelius. [p. 107] 5. Manuscripts and editions There are nine MSS. on which the printed texts of the Laelius are chiefly based: G (Gudianus), at Wolfenbüttel, 10th century; E (Erfurtensis), once at Erfurt, now in Berlin, 12th century; B (Benedictoburanus), in Munich, 12th century; S (Salsiburgensis), in Munich, 11th century; M (Monacensis), in Munich; and P (Parisinus), formerly in Paris, now in Berlin, 9th or 10th century; two MSS., DV (Vindobonensis), in Vienna; and H (Harleianus), in the British Museum, London. Of these Halm regards G as best and C. F. W. Müller prefers P. The text of the present edition, like that of Cato Maior, is eclectic, following most closely, perhaps, the edition of J. S. Reid, but with readings adopted from Müller, Bennett and others. For a good. bibliography of the Laelius reference is made to E. W. Bowen's Laelius. The translator is indebted to Prof. Henry Strauss and Dr. J. L. Hancock, of the University of Arkansas, for a careful reading of the manuscript and for many valuable suggestions in interpretation and phrasing.",,"Introduction to the Laelius,,1.

Celsus,De Medicina,"Book I, Prooemium","Prooemium Just as agriculture promises nourishment to healthy bodies, so does the Art of Medicine promise health to the sick. Nowhere is this Art wanting, for the most uncivilized nations have had knowledge of herbs, and other things to hand for the aiding of wounds and diseases. This Art, however, has been cultivated among the Greeks much more than in other nations — not, however, even among them from their first beginnings, but only for a few generations before ours. Hence Aesculapius is celebrated as the most ancient authority, and because he cultivated this science, as yet rude and vulgar, with a little more than common refinement, he was numbered among the gods. After him his two sons, Podalirius and Machaon, who followed Agamemnon as leader to the Trojan War, gave no inconsiderable help to their comrades. Homer stated, however, not that they gave any aid in the pestilence or in the various sorts of diseases, but only that they relieved wounds by the knife and by medicaments. Hence it appears that by them those parts only of the Art were attempted, and that they were the oldest. [p. 5] From the same authority, indeed, it can be learned that diseases were then ascribed to the anger of the immortal gods, and from them help used to be sought; and it is probable that with no aids against bad health, none the less health was generally good because of good habits, which neither indolence nor luxury had vitiated: since it is these two which have afflicted the bodies of men, first in Greece, and later amongst us; and hence this complex Art of Medicine, not needed in former times, nor among other nations even now, scarcely protracts the lives of a few of us to the verge of old age. Therefore even after these I have mentioned, no distinguished men practised the Art of Medicine until literary studies began to be pursued with more attention, which more than anything else are a necessity for the spirit, but at the same time are bad for the body. At first the science of healing was held to be part of philosophy, so that treatment of disease and contemplation of the nature of things began through the same authorities; clearly because healing was needed especially by those whose bodily strength had been weakened by restless thinking and night-watching. Hence we find that many who professed philosophy became expert in medicine, the most celebrated being Pythagoras, Empedocles and Democritus. But it was, as some believe, a pupil of the last, Hippocrates of Cos, a man first and foremost worthy to be remembered, notable both for professional skill and for eloquence, who separated this branch of learning from the study of philosophy. After him [p. 7] Diocles of Carystus, next Praxagoras and Chrysippus, then Herophilus and Erasistratus, so practised this art that they made advances even towards various methods of treatment. During the same times the Art of Medicine was divided into three parts: one being that which cures through diet, another through medicaments, and the third by hand. The Greeks termed the first Διαιτητικήν , the second Φαρμακευτικήν , the third Χειρουργίαν . But of that part which cured diseases by diet those who were by far the most famous authorities, endeavouring to go more deeply into things, claimed for themselves also a knowledge of nature, without which it seemed that the Art of Medicine would be stunted and weak. After them first of all Serapion, declaring that this kind of reasoning method was in no way pertinent to Medicine, based it only upon practice and upon experience. To him followed Apollonius and Glaucias, and somewhat later Heraclides of Tarentum, and other men of no small note, who in accordance with what they professed called themselves Empirici (or Experimentalists). Thus this Art of Medicine which treats by diet was also divided into two parts, some claiming an Art based upon speculation, others on practice alone. But after those mentioned above no one troubled about anything except what tradition had handed down to him until Asclepiades changed in large measure the way of curing. Of his successors, Themison, late in life, diverged from Asclepiades in some respects. And it is through these men in particular that this health-giving profession of ours has grown up. Since of the divisions of the Art of Medicine, the [p. 9] one which heals diseases, as it is the most difficult, is also the most famous, we must speak about it first. And because there is a primary difference of opinion, so holding that the sole knowledge necessary is derived from experience, others propounding that practice is not efficient enough except after acquiring a reasoned knowledge of human bodies and of nature, I must indicate which are the principal statements on either side, so that I may the more easily interpose my own opinion also. They, then, who profess a reasoned theory of medicine propound as requisites, first, a knowledge of hidden causes involving diseases, next, of evident causes, after these of natural actions also, and lastly of the internal parts. They term hidden, the causes concerning which inquiry is made into the principles composing our bodies, what makes for and what against health. For they believe it impossible for one who is ignorant of the origin of diseases to learn how to treat them suitably. They say that it does not admit of doubt that there is need for differences in treatment, if, as certain of the professors of philosophy have stated, some excess, or some deficiency, among the four elements, creates adverse health; or, if all the fault is in the humours, as was the view of Herophilus; or in the breath, according to Hippocrates; or if blood is transfused into those blood-vessels which are fitted for pneuma, and excites inflammation [p. 11] which the Greeks term φλεγμόνην , and that inflammation effects such a disturbance as there is in fever, which was taught by Erasistratus; or if little bodies by being brought to a standstill in passing through invisible pores block the passage, as Asclepiades contended — his will be the right way of treatment, who has not failed to see the primary origin of the cause. They do not deny that experience is also necessary; but they say it is impossible to arrive at what should be done unless through some course of reasoning. For the older men, they say, did not cram the sick anyhow, but reasoned out what might be especially suitable, and then put to the test of experience what conjecture of a sort had previously led up to. Again they say that it makes no matter whether by now most remedies have been well explored already . . . if, nevertheless, they started from a reasoned theory; and that in fact this has also been done in many instances. Frequently, too, novel classes of disease occur about which hitherto practice has disclosed nothing, and so it is necessary to consider how such have commenced, without which no one among mortals can possibly find out whether this rather than that remedy should be used; this is the reason why they investigate the occult causes. But they call evident those causes, concerning which they inquire, as to whether heat or cold, hunger or surfeit, or such like, has brought about the commencement of the disease; for they say that he will be the one to counter the malady who is not ignorant of its origin. Further, they term natural actions of the body, those by which we draw in and emit breath, take in [p. 13] and digest food and drink, as also those actions through which food and drink are distributed into every part of the members. Moreover, they also inquire why our blood-vessels now subside, now swell up; what is the explanation of sleep and wakefulness: for without knowledge of these they hold that no one can encounter or remedy the diseases which spring up in connexion with them. Among these natural actions digestion seems of most importance, so they give it their chief attention. Some following Erasistratus hold that in the belly the food is ground up; others, following Plistonicus, a pupil of Praxagoras, that it putrefies; others believe with Hippocrates, that food is cooked up by heat. In addition there are the followers of Asclepiades, who propound that all such notions are vain and superfluous, that there is no concoction at all, but that material is transmitted through the body, crude as swallowed. And on these points there is little agreement indeed among them; but what does follow is that a different food is to be given to patients according as this or that view is true. For if it is ground up inside, that food should be selected which can be ground up the most readily; if it putrefies, that which does so most expeditiously; if heat concocts it, that which most excites heat. But none of these points need be inquired into if there be no concoction but such things be taken which persist most in the state in which they were when swallowed. In the same way, when breathing is laboured, when sleep or wakefulness disturbs, they deem him able to remedy it who had understood beforehand how these same natural actions happen. Moreover, as pains, and also various kinds of [p. 15] diseases, arise in the more internal parts, they hold that no one can apply remedies for these who is ignorant about the parts themselves; hence it becomes necessary to lay open the bodies of the dead and to scrutinize their viscera and intestines. They hold that Herophilus did this in the best way by far, when they laid open men whilst alive — criminals received out of prison from the kings — and while these were still breathing, observed parts which beforehand nature had concealed, their position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, relation, processes and depressions of each, and whether any part is inserted into or is received into another. For when pain occurs internally, neither is it possible for one to learn what hurts the patient, unless he had acquainted himself with the position of each organ or intestine; nor can a diseased portion of the body be treated by one who does not know what that portion is. When a man's viscera are exposed in a wound, he who is ignorant of the colour of a part in health may be unable to recognize which part is intact, and which part damaged; thus he cannot even relieve the damaged part. External remedies too can be applied more aptly by one acquainted with the position, shape and size of the internal organs, and like reasonings hold good in all the instances mentioned above. Nor is it, as most people say, cruel that in the execution of criminals, and but a few of them, we should seek remedies for innocent people of all future ages. On the other hand, those who are called Empirici because they have experience, do indeed accept evident causes as necessary; but they contend [p. 17] that inquiry about obscure causes and natural actions is superfluous, because nature is not to be comprehended. That nature cannot be comprehended is in fact patent, they say, from the disagreement among those who discuss such matters; for on this question there is no agreement, either among professors of philosophy or among actual medical practitioners. Why, then, should anyone believe rather in Hippocrates than in Herophilus, why in him rather than in Asclepiades? If one wants to be guided by reasoning, they go on, the reasoning of all of them can appear not improbable; if by method of treatment, all of them have restored sick folk to health: therefore one ought not to derogate from anyone's credit, either in argument or in authority. Even philosophers would have become the greatest of medical practitioners, if reasoning from theory could have made them so; as it is, they have words in plenty, and no knowledge of healing at all. They also say that the methods of practice differ according to the nature of localities, and that one method is required in Rome, another in Egypt, another in Gaul; but that if the causes which produce diseases whether everywhere the same, the same remedies should be used everywhere; that often, too, the causes are apparent, as, for example, of ophthalmia, or of wounds, yet such causes do not disclose the treatment: that if the evident cause does not supply the knowledge, much less can a cause which is in doubt yield it. Since, therefore, the cause is as uncertain as it is incomprehensible, protection is to be sought rather from the ascertained and explored, as in all the rest of the Arts, that is, from what experience has taught in the actual course of treatment: for [p. 19] even a farmer, or a pilot, is made not by disputation but by practice. That such speculations are not pertinent to the Art of Medicine may be learned from the fact that men may hold different opinions on these matters, yet conduct their patients to recovery all the same. This has happened, not because they deduced lines of healing from obscure causes, nor from the natural actions, concerning which different opinions were held, but from experiences of what had previously succeeded. Even in its beginnings, they add, the Art of Medicine was not deduced from such questionings, but from experience; for of the sick who were without doctors, some in the first days of illness, longing for food, took it forthwith; others, owing to distaste, abstained; and the illness was more alleviated in those who abstained. Again, some partook of food whilst actually under the fever, some a little before, others after its remission, and it went best with those who did so after the fever had ended; and similarly some at the beginning adopted at once a rather full diet, others a scanty one, and those were made worse who had eaten plentifully. When this and the like happened day after day, careful men noted what generally answered the better, and then began to prescribe the same for their patients. Thus sprang up the Art of Medicine, which, from the frequent recovery of some and the death of others, distinguished between the pernicious and the salutary. It was afterwards, they proceed, when the remedies had already been discovered, that men began to discuss the reasons for them: the Art of Medicine was not a discovery following upon reasoning, but after the discovery of the remedy, the reason for it was [p. 21] sought out. They ask, too, does reasoning teach the same as experience? If the same, it was needless; if something else, then it was even opposed to it: nevertheless, at first remedies had to be explored with the greatest care; now, however, they have been explored already; there were neither new sorts of diseases to be found out, nor was a novel remedy wanted. For even if there happened nowadays some unknown form of malady, nevertheless the practitioner had not to theorize over obscure matters, but straightway would see to which disease it came nearest, then would make trial of remedies similar to those which have succeeded often in a kindred affection, and so through its similarities find help; that is not to say that a practitioner had no need to take counsel, and that an irrational animal was capable of exhibiting this art, but that these conjectures about concealed matters are of no concern because it does not matter what produces the disease but what relieves it; nor does it matter how digestion takes place, but what is best digested, whether concoction comes about from this cause or that, and whether the process is concoction or merely distribution. We had no need to inquire in what way we breathe, but what relieves laboured breathing; not what may move the blood-vessels, but what the various kinds of movements signify. All this was to be learnt through experiences; and in all theorizing over a subject it is possible to argue on either side, and so cleverness and fluency may get the best of it; it is not, however, by eloquence but by remedies that diseases are treated. A man of few words who learns by practice to discern well, would make an altogether better practitioner than he who, unpractised, over-cultivates his tongue. [p. 23] Now the matters just referred to they deem to be superfluous; but what remains, cruel as well, to cut into the belly and chest of men whilst still alive, and to impose upon the Art which presides over human safety someone's death, and that too in the most atrocious way. Especially is this true when, of things which are sought for with so much violence, some can be learnt not at all, others can be learnt even without a crime. For when the body had been laid open, colour, smoothness, softness, hardness and all similars would not be such as they were when the body was untouched; because bodies, even when uninjured yet often change in appearance, they note, from fear, pain, want of food, indigestion, weariness and a thousand other mediocre affections; it is much more likely that the more internal parts, which are far softer, and to which the very light is something novel, should under the most severe of woundings, in fact mangling, undergo changes. Nor is anything more foolish, they say, than to suppose that whatever the condition of the part of a man's body in life, it will also be the same when he is dying, nay, when he is already dead; for the belly indeed, which is of less importance, can be laid open with the man still breathing; but as soon as the knife really penetrates to the chest, by cutting through the transverse septum, a sort of membrane which divides the upper from the lower parts (the Greeks call it dia/fragma), the man loses his life at once: so it is only when the man is dead that the chest and any of the viscera come into the view of the medical murderer, and they are necessarily those of a dead, not of a living man. It follows, therefore, that the medical man just plays the cut-throat, not that he learns [p. 25] what our viscera are like when we are alive. If, however, there be anything to be observed whilst a man is still breathing, chance often presents it to the view of those treating him. For sometimes a gladiator in the arena, or a soldier in battle, or a traveller who has been set upon by robbers, is so wounded that some or other interior part is exposed in one man or another. Thus, they say, an observant practitioner learns to recognize site, position, arrangement, shape and such like, not when slaughtering, but whilst striving for health; and he learns in the course of a work of mercy, what others would come to know by means of dire cruelty. That for these reasons, since most things are altered in the dead, some hold that even the dissection of the dead is unnecessary; although not cruel, it is none the less nasty; but all that is possible to come to know in the living, the actual treatment exhibits. Since all these questions have been discussed often by practitioners, in many volumes and in large and contentious disputations, and the discussion continues, it remains to add such views as may seem nearest the truth. These are neither wholly in accord with one opinion or another, nor exceedingly at variance with both, but hold a sort of intermediate place between divers sentiments, a thing which may be observed in most controversies when men seek impartially for truth, as in the present case. For as regards the causes which either favour health or excite disease, how breath is drawn in or food distributed, not even philosophers attain to full knowledge, but seek it out by conjecture. But where there is no certain knowledge about a thing, mere opinion about it cannot find a certain remedy. [p. 27] And it is true that nothing adds more to a really rational treatment than experience. Although, therefore, many things, which are not strictly pertinent to the Arts as such, are yet helpful by stimulating the minds of those who practise them, so also this contemplation of the nature of things, although it does not make a practitioner, yet renders him more apt and perfected in the Art of Medicine. And it is probable that Hippocrates, Erasistratus and certain others, who were not content to busy themselves over fevers and ulcerations, but also to some extent searched into the nature of things, did not by this become practitioners, but by this became better practitioners. But reasoning is necessary to the Art of Medicine, not only when dealing with obscure causes, or natural actions, but often . . . for it is an art based on conjecture. However, in many cases not only does conjecture fail, but experience as well; and at times, neither fever, nor appetite, nor sleep follow their customary course. More rarely, yet now and again, a disease itself is new. That this does not happen is manifestly untrue, for in our time a lady, from whose genitals flesh had prolapsed and become gangrenous, died in the course of a few hours, whilst practitioners of the highest standing found out neither the class of malady nor a remedy. I conclude that they attempted nothing because no one was willing to risk a conjecture of his own in the case of a distinguished personage, for fear that he might seem to have killed, if he did not save her; [p. 29] yet it is probable that something might possibly have been thought of, had no such timidity prevailed, and perchance this might have been successful had one but tried it. In this sort of practice similarity is not always of service, and when it does prove serviceable, nevertheless there has been a process of reasoning, in the theorizing over similar classes of diseases and of remedies, as to which is the best remedy to use. When, therefore, such an incident occurs, the practitioner ought to arrive at something which may answer, even if perhaps not always, yet nevertheless more often than not. He will see, however, every novel plan, not from hidden things, for these are dubious and unascertainable, but from those which can be explored, that is, from evident causes. For what matters is this: whether fatigue or thirst, whether heat or cold, whether wakefulness or hunger, whether abundance in food or wine, whether intemperance in venery, has produced the disease. Nor should there be ignorance of the sick man's temperament; whether his body is rather humid or rather dry, whether his sinews are strong or weak, whether he is frequently or rarely ill; and when ill whether so severely or slightly, for a short or long while; the kind of life he has lived, laborious or quiet, accompanied by luxury or frugality. From such and similar data, one may often deduce a novel mode of treatment. None the less the foregoing statements ought not to be passed by as if they did not admit of controversy. For Erasistratus himself has affirmed that diseases were not produced by such causes, since other persons, and even the same person at different times, were not rendered feverish by them. Further, [p. 31] certain practitioners of our time, following, as they would have it appear, the authority of Themison, contend that there is no cause whatever, the knowledge of which has any bearing on treatment: they hold that it is sufficient to observe certain general characteristics of diseases; that of these there are three classes, one a constriction, another a flux, the third a mixture. For the sick at one time excrete too little, at another time too much; again, from one part too little, from another too much; and these classes of diseases are sometimes acute, sometimes chronic, at times on the increase, at times constant, at times diminishing. Once it has been recognized, then, which it is of these, if the body is constricted, it has to be relaxed; if suffering from a flux, that has to be controlled; if a mixed lesion, the more severe malady must be countered first. Moreover, there must be treatment of one kind for acute diseases, another kind for chronic ones, another for increasing, stationary, or for those already tending to recovery. They hold that the Art of Medicine consists of such observations; which they define as a sort of way, which they name μέθοδος , and maintain that medicine should examine those characteristics which diseases have in common. They do not want to be classed with reasoners from theory, nor with those who look to experience only; for in so naming themselves Methodici, they dissent from the former because they are unwilling that the Art should consist in conjecture about hidden things, and from the latter because they think that in the observation of experience there is little of an Art of Medicine. As relates to Erasistratus, in the first place the [p. 33] actual evidence is against his opinion, because seldom does a disease occur unless following upon one of these; secondly, it does not follow that what has done no harm to one patient, or to that same patient upon one occasion, may not harm another patient, or the same one at another time. For it is possible that there are certain underlying conditions in the body, whether related to infirmity, or to an actual affection of some kind, which either are not present in another person, or were not existent in that patient on another occasion, and which of themselves are not enough to constitute a disease, yet they may render the body more liable to other injurious affections. But if Erasistratus had been sufficiently versed in the study of the nature of things, as those practitioners rashly claim themselves to be, he would have known also that nothing is due to one cause alone, but that which is taken to be the cause is that which seems to have had the most influence. Indeed it is possible that when one cause acts alone, it may not disturb, yet when acting in conjunction with other causes it may produce a very great disturbance. Moreover, even Erasistratus himself, who says that fever is produced by blood transfused into the arteries, and that this happens in an over-replete body, failed to discover why, of two equally replete persons, one should lapse into disease, and the other remain free from anything dangerous; and that clearly happens every day. Hence, however true this transfusion, one can learn that it does not occur of itself when there is bodily fullness, but when there is added something else. But disciples of Themison, if they hold their [p. 35] precepts to be of constant validity, are reasoners even more than anybody else; for if a man des not hold all the tenets that another reasoner approves, he does not forthwith have to assume a different name for his art, if (and this is the essential point) he does rely not only on written authority, but also upon reasoning from theory. But if, which is nearer to the truth, the Art of Medicine admits of scarcely any universal precepts, reasoners are in the same position as those who depend upon experience alone, all the more because whether the disease has braced or relaxed is what the most uninstructed can see. But if a remedy which loosens a body braced up, or tightens a loosened body, has been deduced by a reasoning from theory, the practitioner is a reasoner; if (as the man who denies himself to be a reasoner must admit) he acts from experience, he is an Empiric. Thus according to Themison, knowledge of a disease is outside the Art, and medicine is confined to practice; nor has there been added anything to what Empirics profess, but something taken away; for reasoners from theory gaze about over a multiplicity of matters, Empirics look to circumstances the most simple, and nothing more than commonplaces. For in like manner those who treat cattle and horses, since it is impossible to learn from dumb animals particulars of their complaints, depend only upon common characteristics; so also do foreigners as they are ignorant of reasoning subtleties look rather to common characteristics of disease. Again, those who take charge of large hospitals, because they cannot pay full attention to individuals, resort to these common characteristics. [p. 37] I vow, the ancients knew all this, but were not content therewith; therefore even the oldest authority, Hippocrates, said that in healing it was necessary to take note both of common and of particular characteristics. Indeed these very Methodici, even within their professed limitations, cannot be consistent; for there are divers kinds of constricting and relaxing diseases, those in which there is a flux being the more easy to observe. For it is one thing to vomit blood, another bile, another food; it is one thing to suffer from diarrhoea, another from dysentery; one thing to be relaxed through sweating, another to be wasted by consumption. Humour may break out into particular parts, such as the eyes or the ears; from a risk of this kind there is no human member free. No one of these occurrences is treated in the same way as another. Hence the Art descends straight down from a consideration of the common characteristics of a flux to the particular case. Moreover, because the same remedies do not meet with success in all, even of similar cases, additional knowledge of peculiarities in such a case is often necessary. Although certain things act upon the bowels in most cases, whether as astringents or as laxatives, yet there are to be found some in whom the same thing acts differently than it does in others. In such instances, therefore, investigation of particular characteristics is salutary, that of common characteristics the reverse. Moreover, a reckoning up of the cause often solves the malady. Thus Cassius, the most ingenious practitioner of our generation, recently dead, in a case suffering from fever and great thirst, when he learnt that the man had begun to feel oppressed after intoxication, [p. 39] administered cold water, by which draught, when by the admixture he had broken the force of the wine, he forthwith dispersed the fever by means of a sleep and a sweat. He, as a practitioner, provided an opportune remedy, not out of consideration whether the man's body was constricted or relaxed, but from what had happened beforehand to cause it. Besides, according to these very authorities there are particulars relating to locality and to season. When they are discussing what should be done by men in health, they prescribe the avoidance of cold, heat, surfeit, fatigue, venery, especially in sickly localities and seasons; in such places and seasons rest is to be taken, particularly when one feels a sense of oppression, and neither the stomach is to be disturbed by an emetic, nor the bowels by a purge. Such generalities are indeed true: none the less they descend from them to certain particular characteristics, unless they would persuade us that climate and season are to be taken into consideration by those in health but not by the sick, the very persons in whom all such observance is by so much the more necessary, the more that their weakness is liable to all attacks. Nay, even in the same patient, the particular characteristics of a disease are very various, and those who have been treated for a time in vain by the ordinary remedies have been often restored by contrary ones. And in the giving food too there are many distinctions to be noted; I will content myself with one instance. For hunger is more easily borne by an adult than by a boy, more easily in a dense than in a thin atmosphere, more easily in winter than in summer, more easily by one accustomed to a single meal than by one used in addition to one at midday, [p. 41] more easily when sedentary than when in active exercise; and often it is necessary to hurry on the meal in the case of one who is intolerant of hunger. Hence I conjecture that he who is not acquainted with the peculiar characteristics has merely to consider the general ones; and he who can become acquainted with peculiarities, whilst insistent upon them, ought not to neglect generalities as well; and consequently, presuming their state to be equal, it is more useful to have in the practitioner a friend rather than a stranger. Therefore, to return to what I myself propound, I am of opinion that the Art of Medicine ought to be rational, but to draw instruction from evident causes, all obscure ones being rejected from the practice of the Art, although not from the practitioner's study. But to lay open the bodies of men whilst still alive is as cruel as it is needless; that of the dead is a necessity for the learner, who should know positions and relations, which the dead body exhibits better than does a living and wounded man. As for the remainder, which can only be learnt from the living, actual practice will demonstrate it in the course of treating the wounded in a somewhat slower yet much milder way. With these premises I will first speak of how those in health should act (Book I), than I will pass on to what pertains to diseases (Book II, 1‑8), and to their treatments (Book II, 9‑33).",,"Prooemium,Just as agriculture promises nourishment to healthy bodies, so does the Art of Medicine promise health to the sick. Nowhere is this Art wanting, for the most uncivilized nations have had knowledge of herbs, and other things to hand for the aiding of wounds and diseases. This Art, however, has been cultivated among the Greeks much more than in other nations — not, however, even among them from their first beginnings, but only for a few generations before ours. Hence Aesculapius is celebrated as the most ancient authority, and because he cultivated this science, as yet rude and vulgar, with a little more than common refinement, he was numbered among the gods. After him his two sons, Podalirius and Machaon, who followed Agamemnon as leader to the Trojan War, gave no inconsiderable help to their comrades. Homer stated, however, not that they gave any aid in the pestilence or in the various sorts of diseases, but only that they relieved wounds by the knife and by medicaments. Hence it appears that by them those parts only of the Art were attempted, and that they were the oldest.,[p. 5],From the same authority, indeed, it can be learned that diseases were then ascribed to the anger of the immortal gods, and from them help used to be sought; and it is probable that with no aids against bad health, none the less health was generally good because of good habits, which neither indolence nor luxury had vitiated: since it is these two which have afflicted the bodies of men, first in Greece, and later amongst us; and hence this complex Art of Medicine, not needed in former times, nor among other nations even now, scarcely protracts the lives of a few of us to the verge of old age.,Therefore even after these I have mentioned, no distinguished men practised the Art of Medicine until literary studies began to be pursued with more attention, which more than anything else are a necessity for the spirit, but at the same time are bad for the body. At first the science of healing was held to be part of philosophy, so that treatment of disease and contemplation of the nature of things began through the same authorities; clearly because healing was needed especially by those whose bodily strength had been weakened by restless thinking and night-watching. Hence we find that many who professed philosophy became expert in medicine, the most celebrated being Pythagoras, Empedocles and Democritus. But it was, as some believe, a pupil of the last, Hippocrates of Cos, a man first and foremost worthy to be remembered, notable both for professional skill and for eloquence, who separated this branch of learning from the study of philosophy. After him,[p. 7],Diocles of Carystus, next Praxagoras and Chrysippus, then Herophilus and Erasistratus, so practised this art that they made advances even towards various methods of treatment.,During the same times the Art of Medicine was divided into three parts: one being that which cures through diet, another through medicaments, and the third by hand. The Greeks termed the first,Διαιτητικήν,, the second,Φαρμακευτικήν,, the third,Χειρουργίαν,. But of that part which cured diseases by diet those who were by far the most famous authorities, endeavouring to go more deeply into things, claimed for themselves also a knowledge of nature, without which it seemed that the Art of Medicine would be stunted and weak. After them first of all Serapion, declaring that this kind of reasoning method was in no way pertinent to Medicine, based it only upon practice and upon experience. To him followed Apollonius and Glaucias, and somewhat later Heraclides of Tarentum, and other men of no small note, who in accordance with what they professed called themselves Empirici (or Experimentalists). Thus this Art of Medicine which treats by diet was also divided into two parts, some claiming an Art based upon speculation, others on practice alone. But after those mentioned above no one troubled about anything except what tradition had handed down to him until Asclepiades changed in large measure the way of curing. Of his successors, Themison, late in life, diverged from Asclepiades in some respects. And it is through these men in particular that this health-giving profession of ours has grown up.,Since of the divisions of the Art of Medicine, the,[p. 9],one which heals diseases, as it is the most difficult, is also the most famous, we must speak about it first. And because there is a primary difference of opinion, so holding that the sole knowledge necessary is derived from experience, others propounding that practice is not efficient enough except after acquiring a reasoned knowledge of human bodies and of nature, I must indicate which are the principal statements on either side, so that I may the more easily interpose my own opinion also.,They, then, who profess a reasoned theory of medicine propound as requisites, first, a knowledge of  hidden causes involving diseases, next, of  evident causes, after these of  natural actions  also, and lastly of  the internal parts.,They term hidden, the causes concerning which inquiry is made into the principles composing our bodies, what makes for and what against health. For they believe it impossible for one who is ignorant of the origin of diseases to learn how to treat them suitably. They say that it does not admit of doubt that there is need for differences in treatment, if, as certain of the professors of philosophy have stated, some excess, or some deficiency, among the four elements, creates adverse health; or, if all the fault is in the humours, as was the view of Herophilus; or in the breath, according to Hippocrates; or if blood is transfused into those blood-vessels which are fitted for pneuma, and excites inflammation,[p. 11],which the Greeks term,φλεγμόνην,, and that inflammation effects such a disturbance as there is in fever, which was taught by Erasistratus; or if little bodies by being brought to a standstill in passing through invisible pores block the passage, as Asclepiades contended — his will be the right way of treatment, who has not failed to see the primary origin of the cause. They do not deny that experience is also necessary; but they say it is impossible to arrive at what should be done unless through some course of reasoning. For the older men, they say, did not cram the sick anyhow, but reasoned out what might be especially suitable, and then put to the test of experience what conjecture of a sort had previously led up to. Again they say that it makes no matter whether by now most remedies have been well explored already . . . if, nevertheless, they started from a reasoned theory; and that in fact this has also been done in many instances. Frequently, too, novel classes of disease occur about which hitherto practice has disclosed nothing, and so it is necessary to consider how such have commenced, without which no one among mortals can possibly find out whether this rather than that remedy should be used; this is the reason why they investigate the occult causes.,But they call evident those causes, concerning which they inquire, as to whether heat or cold, hunger or surfeit, or such like, has brought about the commencement of the disease; for they say that he will be the one to counter the malady who is not ignorant of its origin.,Further, they term natural actions of the body, those by which we draw in and emit breath, take in,[p. 13],and digest food and drink, as also those actions through which food and drink are distributed into every part of the members. Moreover, they also inquire why our blood-vessels now subside, now swell up; what is the explanation of sleep and wakefulness: for without knowledge of these they hold that no one can encounter or remedy the diseases which spring up in connexion with them. Among these natural actions digestion seems of most importance, so they give it their chief attention. Some following Erasistratus hold that in the belly the food is ground up; others, following Plistonicus, a pupil of Praxagoras, that it putrefies; others believe with Hippocrates, that food is cooked up by heat. In addition there are the followers of Asclepiades, who propound that all such notions are vain and superfluous, that there is no concoction at all, but that material is transmitted through the body, crude as swallowed. And on these points there is little agreement indeed among them; but what does follow is that a different food is to be given to patients according as this or that view is true. For if it is ground up inside, that food should be selected which can be ground up the most readily; if it putrefies, that which does so most expeditiously; if heat concocts it, that which most excites heat. But none of these points need be inquired into if there be no concoction but such things be taken which persist most in the state in which they were when swallowed. In the same way, when breathing is laboured, when sleep or wakefulness disturbs, they deem him able to remedy it who had understood beforehand how these same natural actions happen.,Moreover, as pains, and also various kinds of,[p. 15],diseases, arise in the more internal parts, they hold that no one can apply remedies for these who is ignorant about the parts themselves; hence it becomes necessary to lay open the bodies of the dead and to scrutinize their viscera and intestines. They hold that Herophilus did this in the best way by far, when they laid open men whilst alive — criminals received out of prison from the kings — and while these were still breathing, observed parts which beforehand nature had concealed, their position, colour, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, relation, processes and depressions of each, and whether any part is inserted into or is received into another. For when pain occurs internally, neither is it possible for one to learn what hurts the patient, unless he had acquainted himself with the position of each organ or intestine; nor can a diseased portion of the body be treated by one who does not know what that portion is. When a man's viscera are exposed in a wound, he who is ignorant of the colour of a part in health may be unable to recognize which part is intact, and which part damaged; thus he cannot even relieve the damaged part. External remedies too can be applied more aptly by one acquainted with the position, shape and size of the internal organs, and like reasonings hold good in all the instances mentioned above. Nor is it, as most people say, cruel that in the execution of criminals, and but a few of them, we should seek remedies for innocent people of all future ages.,On the other hand, those who are called ""Empirici"" because they have experience, do indeed accept evident causes as necessary; but they contend,[p. 17],that inquiry about obscure causes and natural actions is superfluous, because nature is not to be comprehended. That nature cannot be comprehended is in fact patent, they say, from the disagreement among those who discuss such matters; for on this question there is no agreement, either among professors of philosophy or among actual medical practitioners. Why, then, should anyone believe rather in Hippocrates than in Herophilus, why in him rather than in Asclepiades? If one wants to be guided by reasoning, they go on, the reasoning of all of them can appear not improbable; if by method of treatment, all of them have restored sick folk to health: therefore one ought not to derogate from anyone's credit, either in argument or in authority. Even philosophers would have become the greatest of medical practitioners, if reasoning from theory could have made them so; as it is, they have words in plenty, and no knowledge of healing at all. They also say that the methods of practice differ according to the nature of localities, and that one method is required in Rome, another in Egypt, another in Gaul; but that if the causes which produce diseases whether everywhere the same, the same remedies should be used everywhere; that often, too, the causes are apparent, as, for example, of ophthalmia, or of wounds, yet such causes do not disclose the treatment: that if the evident cause does not supply the knowledge, much less can a cause which is in doubt yield it. Since, therefore, the cause is as uncertain as it is incomprehensible, protection is to be sought rather from the ascertained and explored, as in all the rest of the Arts, that is, from what experience has taught in the actual course of treatment: for,[p. 19],even a farmer, or a pilot, is made not by disputation but by practice. That such speculations are not pertinent to the Art of Medicine may be learned from the fact that men may hold different opinions on these matters, yet conduct their patients to recovery all the same. This has happened, not because they deduced lines of healing from obscure causes, nor from the natural actions, concerning which different opinions were held, but from experiences of what had previously succeeded. Even in its beginnings, they add, the Art of Medicine was not deduced from such questionings, but from experience; for of the sick who were without doctors, some in the first days of illness, longing for food, took it forthwith; others, owing to distaste, abstained; and the illness was more alleviated in those who abstained. Again, some partook of food whilst actually under the fever, some a little before, others after its remission, and it went best with those who did so after the fever had ended; and similarly some at the beginning adopted at once a rather full diet, others a scanty one, and those were made worse who had eaten plentifully. When this and the like happened day after day, careful men noted what generally answered the better, and then began to prescribe the same for their patients. Thus sprang up the Art of Medicine, which, from the frequent recovery of some and the death of others, distinguished between the pernicious and the salutary.,It was afterwards, they proceed, when the remedies had already been discovered, that men began to discuss the reasons for them: the Art of Medicine was not a discovery following upon reasoning, but after the discovery of the remedy, the reason for it was,[p. 21],sought out. They ask, too, does reasoning teach the same as experience? If the same, it was needless; if something else, then it was even opposed to it: nevertheless, at first remedies had to be explored with the greatest care; now, however, they have been explored already; there were neither new sorts of diseases to be found out, nor was a novel remedy wanted. For even if there happened nowadays some unknown form of malady, nevertheless the practitioner had not to theorize over obscure matters, but straightway would see to which disease it came nearest, then would make trial of remedies similar to those which have succeeded often in a kindred affection, and so through its similarities find help; that is not to say that a practitioner had no need to take counsel, and that an irrational animal was capable of exhibiting this art, but that these conjectures about concealed matters are of no concern because it does not matter what produces the disease but what relieves it; nor does it matter how digestion takes place, but what is best digested, whether concoction comes about from this cause or that, and whether the process is concoction or merely distribution. We had no need to inquire in what way we breathe, but what relieves laboured breathing; not what may move the blood-vessels, but what the various kinds of movements signify. All this was to be learnt through experiences; and in all theorizing over a subject it is possible to argue on either side, and so cleverness and fluency may get the best of it; it is not, however, by eloquence but by remedies that diseases are treated. A man of few words who learns by practice to discern well, would make an altogether better practitioner than he who, unpractised, over-cultivates his tongue.,[p. 23],Now the matters just referred to they deem to be superfluous; but what remains, cruel as well, to cut into the belly and chest of men whilst still alive, and to impose upon the Art which presides over human safety someone's death, and that too in the most atrocious way. Especially is this true when, of things which are sought for with so much violence, some can be learnt not at all, others can be learnt even without a crime. For when the body had been laid open, colour, smoothness, softness, hardness and all similars would not be such as they were when the body was untouched; because bodies, even when uninjured yet often change in appearance, they note, from fear, pain, want of food, indigestion, weariness and a thousand other mediocre affections; it is much more likely that the more internal parts, which are far softer, and to which the very light is something novel, should under the most severe of woundings, in fact mangling, undergo changes. Nor is anything more foolish, they say, than to suppose that whatever the condition of the part of a man's body in life, it will also be the same when he is dying, nay, when he is already dead; for the belly indeed, which is of less importance, can be laid open with the man still breathing; but as soon as the knife really penetrates to the chest, by cutting through the transverse septum, a sort of membrane which divides the upper from the lower parts (the Greeks call it dia/fragma), the man loses his life at once: so it is only when the man is dead that the chest and any of the viscera come into the view of the medical murderer, and they are necessarily those of a dead, not of a living man. It follows, therefore, that the medical man just plays the cut-throat, not that he learns,[p. 25],what our viscera are like when we are alive. If, however, there be anything to be observed whilst a man is still breathing, chance often presents it to the view of those treating him. For sometimes a gladiator in the arena, or a soldier in battle, or a traveller who has been set upon by robbers, is so wounded that some or other interior part is exposed in one man or another. Thus, they say, an observant practitioner learns to recognize site, position, arrangement, shape and such like, not when slaughtering, but whilst striving for health; and he learns in the course of a work of mercy, what others would come to know by means of dire cruelty. That for these reasons, since most things are altered in the dead, some hold that even the dissection of the dead is unnecessary; although not cruel, it is none the less nasty; but all that is possible to come to know in the living, the actual treatment exhibits.,Since all these questions have been discussed often by practitioners, in many volumes and in large and contentious disputations, and the discussion continues, it remains to add such views as may seem nearest the truth. These are neither wholly in accord with one opinion or another, nor exceedingly at variance with both, but hold a sort of intermediate place between divers sentiments, a thing which may be observed in most controversies when men seek impartially for truth, as in the present case. For as regards the causes which either favour health or excite disease, how breath is drawn in or food distributed, not even philosophers attain to full knowledge, but seek it out by conjecture. But where there is no certain knowledge about a thing, mere opinion about it cannot find a certain remedy.,[p. 27],And it is true that nothing adds more to a really rational treatment than experience. Although, therefore, many things, which are not strictly pertinent to the Arts as such, are yet helpful by stimulating the minds of those who practise them, so also this contemplation of the nature of things, although it does not make a practitioner, yet renders him more apt and perfected in the Art of Medicine. And it is probable that Hippocrates, Erasistratus and certain others, who were not content to busy themselves over fevers and ulcerations, but also to some extent searched into the nature of things, did not by this become practitioners, but by this became better practitioners. But reasoning is necessary to the Art of Medicine, not only when dealing with obscure causes, or natural actions, but often . . . for it is an art based on conjecture. However, in many cases not only does conjecture fail, but experience as well; and at times, neither fever, nor appetite, nor sleep follow their customary course. More rarely, yet now and again, a disease itself is new. That this does not happen is manifestly untrue, for in our time a lady, from whose genitals flesh had prolapsed and become gangrenous, died in the course of a few hours, whilst practitioners of the highest standing found out neither the class of malady nor a remedy. I conclude that they attempted nothing because no one was willing to risk a conjecture of his own in the case of a distinguished personage, for fear that he might seem to have killed, if he did not save her;,[p. 29],yet it is probable that something might possibly have been thought of, had no such timidity prevailed, and perchance this might have been successful had one but tried it. In this sort of practice similarity is not always of service, and when it does prove serviceable, nevertheless there has been a process of reasoning, in the theorizing over similar classes of diseases and of remedies, as to which is the best remedy to use. When, therefore, such an incident occurs, the practitioner ought to arrive at something which may answer, even if perhaps not always, yet nevertheless more often than not. He will see, however, every novel plan, not from hidden things, for these are dubious and unascertainable, but from those which can be explored, that is, from evident causes. For what matters is this: whether fatigue or thirst, whether heat or cold, whether wakefulness or hunger, whether abundance in food or wine, whether intemperance in venery, has produced the disease. Nor should there be ignorance of the sick man's temperament; whether his body is rather humid or rather dry, whether his sinews are strong or weak, whether he is frequently or rarely ill; and when ill whether so severely or slightly, for a short or long while; the kind of life he has lived, laborious or quiet, accompanied by luxury or frugality. From such and similar data, one may often deduce a novel mode of treatment.,None the less the foregoing statements ought not to be passed by as if they did not admit of controversy. For Erasistratus himself has affirmed that diseases were not produced by such causes, since other persons, and even the same person at different times, were not rendered feverish by them. Further,,[p. 31],certain practitioners of our time, following, as they would have it appear, the authority of Themison, contend that there is no cause whatever, the knowledge of which has any bearing on treatment: they hold that it is sufficient to observe certain general characteristics of diseases; that of these there are three classes, one a constriction, another a flux, the third a mixture. For the sick at one time excrete too little, at another time too much; again, from one part too little, from another too much; and these classes of diseases are sometimes acute, sometimes chronic, at times on the increase, at times constant, at times diminishing. Once it has been recognized, then, which it is of these, if the body is constricted, it has to be relaxed; if suffering from a flux, that has to be controlled; if a mixed lesion, the more severe malady must be countered first. Moreover, there must be treatment of one kind for acute diseases, another kind for chronic ones, another for increasing, stationary, or for those already tending to recovery. They hold that the Art of Medicine consists of such observations; which they define as a sort of way, which they name,μέθοδος,, and maintain that medicine should examine those characteristics which diseases have in common. They do not want to be classed with reasoners from theory, nor with those who look to experience only; for in so naming themselves Methodici, they dissent from the former because they are unwilling that the Art should consist in conjecture about hidden things, and from the latter because they think that in the observation of experience there is little of an Art of Medicine.,As relates to Erasistratus, in the first place the,[p. 33],actual evidence is against his opinion, because seldom does a disease occur unless following upon one of these; secondly, it does not follow that what has done no harm to one patient, or to that same patient upon one occasion, may not harm another patient, or the same one at another time. For it is possible that there are certain underlying conditions in the body, whether related to infirmity, or to an actual affection of some kind, which either are not present in another person, or were not existent in that patient on another occasion, and which of themselves are not enough to constitute a disease, yet they may render the body more liable to other injurious affections. But if Erasistratus had been sufficiently versed in the study of the nature of things, as those practitioners rashly claim themselves to be, he would have known also that nothing is due to one cause alone, but that which is taken to be the cause is that which seems to have had the most influence. Indeed it is possible that when one cause acts alone, it may not disturb, yet when acting in conjunction with other causes it may produce a very great disturbance. Moreover, even Erasistratus himself, who says that fever is produced by blood transfused into the arteries, and that this happens in an over-replete body, failed to discover why, of two equally replete persons, one should lapse into disease, and the other remain free from anything dangerous; and that clearly happens every day. Hence, however true this transfusion, one can learn that it does not occur of itself when there is bodily fullness, but when there is added something else.,But disciples of Themison, if they hold their,[p. 35],precepts to be of constant validity, are reasoners even more than anybody else; for if a man des not hold all the tenets that another reasoner approves, he does not forthwith have to assume a different name for his art, if (and this is the essential point) he does rely not only on written authority, but also upon reasoning from theory. But if, which is nearer to the truth, the Art of Medicine admits of scarcely any universal precepts, reasoners are in the same position as those who depend upon experience alone, all the more because whether the disease has braced or relaxed is what the most uninstructed can see. But if a remedy which loosens a body braced up, or tightens a loosened body, has been deduced by a reasoning from theory, the practitioner is a reasoner; if (as the man who denies himself to be a reasoner must admit) he acts from experience, he is an Empiric. Thus according to Themison, knowledge of a disease is outside the Art, and medicine is confined to practice; nor has there been added anything to what Empirics profess, but something taken away; for reasoners from theory gaze about over a multiplicity of matters, Empirics look to circumstances the most simple, and nothing more than commonplaces. For in like manner those who treat cattle and horses, since it is impossible to learn from dumb animals particulars of their complaints, depend only upon common characteristics; so also do foreigners as they are ignorant of reasoning subtleties look rather to common characteristics of disease. Again, those who take charge of large hospitals, because they cannot pay full attention to individuals, resort to these common characteristics.,[p. 37],I vow, the ancients knew all this, but were not content therewith; therefore even the oldest authority, Hippocrates, said that in healing it was necessary to take note both of common and of particular characteristics. Indeed these very Methodici, even within their professed limitations, cannot be consistent; for there are divers kinds of constricting and relaxing diseases, those in which there is a flux being the more easy to observe. For it is one thing to vomit blood, another bile, another food; it is one thing to suffer from diarrhoea, another from dysentery; one thing to be relaxed through sweating, another to be wasted by consumption. Humour may break out into particular parts, such as the eyes or the ears; from a risk of this kind there is no human member free. No one of these occurrences is treated in the same way as another.,Hence the Art descends straight down from a consideration of the common characteristics of a flux to the particular case. Moreover, because the same remedies do not meet with success in all, even of similar cases, additional knowledge of peculiarities in such a case is often necessary. Although certain things act upon the bowels in most cases, whether as astringents or as laxatives, yet there are to be found some in whom the same thing acts differently than it does in others. In such instances, therefore, investigation of particular characteristics is salutary, that of common characteristics the reverse. Moreover, a reckoning up of the cause often solves the malady. Thus Cassius, the most ingenious practitioner of our generation, recently dead, in a case suffering from fever and great thirst, when he learnt that the man had begun to feel oppressed after intoxication,,[p. 39],administered cold water, by which draught, when by the admixture he had broken the force of the wine, he forthwith dispersed the fever by means of a sleep and a sweat. He, as a practitioner, provided an opportune remedy, not out of consideration whether the man's body was constricted or relaxed, but from what had happened beforehand to cause it. Besides, according to these very authorities there are particulars relating to locality and to season. When they are discussing what should be done by men in health, they prescribe the avoidance of cold, heat, surfeit, fatigue, venery, especially in sickly localities and seasons; in such places and seasons rest is to be taken, particularly when one feels a sense of oppression, and neither the stomach is to be disturbed by an emetic, nor the bowels by a purge. Such generalities are indeed true: none the less they descend from them to certain particular characteristics, unless they would persuade us that climate and season are to be taken into consideration by those in health but not by the sick, the very persons in whom all such observance is by so much the more necessary, the more that their weakness is liable to all attacks. Nay, even in the same patient, the particular characteristics of a disease are very various, and those who have been treated for a time in vain by the ordinary remedies have been often restored by contrary ones. And in the giving food too there are many distinctions to be noted; I will content myself with one instance. For hunger is more easily borne by an adult than by a boy, more easily in a dense than in a thin atmosphere, more easily in winter than in summer, more easily by one accustomed to a single meal than by one used in addition to one at midday,,[p. 41],more easily when sedentary than when in active exercise; and often it is necessary to hurry on the meal in the case of one who is intolerant of hunger. Hence I conjecture that he who is not acquainted with the peculiar characteristics has merely to consider the general ones; and he who can become acquainted with peculiarities, whilst insistent upon them, ought not to neglect generalities as well; and consequently, presuming their state to be equal, it is more useful to have in the practitioner a friend rather than a stranger.,Therefore, to return to what I myself propound, I am of opinion that the Art of Medicine ought to be rational, but to draw instruction from evident causes, all obscure ones being rejected from the practice of the Art, although not from the practitioner's study. But to lay open the bodies of men whilst still alive is as cruel as it is needless; that of the dead is a necessity for the learner, who should know positions and relations, which the dead body exhibits better than does a living and wounded man. As for the remainder, which can only be learnt from the living, actual practice will demonstrate it in the course of treating the wounded in a somewhat slower yet much milder way.,With these premises I will first speak of how those in health should act  (Book I), than I will pass on to what pertains to diseases  (Book II, 1‑8), and to their treatments  (Book II, 9‑33).,"

First of all—to seek authority from the most distant sources—the Assyrians, on account of the vast plains inhabited by them, and because of the open and unobstructed view of the heavens presented to them on every [p. 225] side, took observations of the paths and movements of the stars, and, having made note of them, transmitted to posterity what significance they had for each person. And in that same nation the Chaldeans—a name which they derived not from their art but their race 1 —have, it is thought, by means of long-continued observation of the constellations, perfected a science which enables them to foretell what any man's lot will be and for what fate he was born.

It is well also at times to go to the bath, at times to make use of cold waters; to undergo sometimes inunction, sometimes to neglect that same; to avoid no kind of food in common use; to attend at times a banquet, at times to hold aloof; to eat more than sufficient at one time, at another no more; to take food twice rather than once a day, and always as much as one wants provided one digests it.

M. Tullius Cicero,Letters,Introduction,"Introduction Ground covered by the Correspondence. The correspondence of Cicero, as preserved for us by his freedman Tiro, does not open till the thirty-ninth year of the orator's life, and is so strictly contemporary, dealing so exclusively with the affairs of the moment, that little light is thrown by it on by his previous life. It does not become continuous till the year after his consulship (B.C. 62). There are no letters in the year of the consulship itself or the year of his canvass for the consulship (B.C. 64 and 63). It begins in B.C. 68, and between that date and B.C. 65 there are only eleven letters. We have, therefore, nothing exactly contemporaneous to help us to form a judgment on the great event which coloured so much of his after life, the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy and the execution of the conspirators, in the last month of his consulship. But setting aside the first eleven letters, we have from that time forward a correspondence illustrating, as no other document in antiquity does, the hopes and fears, the doubts and difficulties, of a keen politician living through the most momentous period of Roman history, the period of the fall of the Republic, beginning with Pompey's return from the East in B.C. 62, and ending with the appearance of the young Octavian on the scene and the formation of the Triumvirate in B.C. 43, of whose victims Cicero was one of the first and most illustrious. It is by his conduct and speeches during this period that Cicero's claim to be a statesman and a patriot must be judged, and by his writings in the same period that his place in literature must chiefly be assigned. Before B.C. 63 his biography, if we had it, would be that of the advocate and the official, no doubt with certain general views on political questions as they occurred, but not yet committed definitely to a party, or inclined to regard politics as the absorbing interest of his life. In his early youth his hero had been his fellow townsman Marius, in whose honour he composed a poem about the time of taking the toga virilis . But it was as the successful general, and before the days of the civil war. And though he served in the army of Sulla in the Marsic war (B.C. 90—88), he always regarded his cruelties with horror, however much he may have afterwards approved of certain points of his legislation. It was not till the consulship that he became definitely a party man 1 and an Optimate, and even then his feelings were much distracted by a strong belief—strangely ill-founded—that Pompey would be as successful as a statesman as he had been fortunate as a general. For him he had also a warm personal attachment, which never seems to have wholly died out, in spite of much petulance of language. This partly accounts for the surrender of B.C. 56, and his acquiescence in the policy of the triumvirs, an acquiescence never hearty indeed, as far as Caesar and Crassus were concerned, but in which he consoled himself with the belief that nothing very unconstitutional could be done while Pompey was practically directing affairs at Rome . The various nature of the Correspondence. It is through this period of political change and excitement that the correspondence will take us, with some important gaps indeed, but on the whole fullest when it is most wanted to show the feelings and motives guiding the active politicians of the day, or at any rate the effect which events had upon one eager and acute intellect and sensitive heart. One charm of the correspondence is variety. There is almost every sort of letter. Those to Atticus are unstudied, spontaneous, and reflect the varying moods of the writer. At times of special excitement they follow each other day by day, and sometimes more than once in the same day; and the writer seems to conceal nothing, however much it might expose him to ridicule, and to the charge of fickleness, weakness, or even cowardice. Those addressed to other friends are sometimes familiar and playful, some times angry and indignant. Some of them are careful and elaborate state papers, others mere formal introductions and recommendations. Business, literature, and philosophy all have their share in them; and, what is so rare in ancient literature, the family relations of the writer, his dealings with wife, son, and daughter, brother and nephew, and sons-in-law, are all depicted for us, often with the utmost frankness. After reading them we seem to know Cicero the man, as well as Cicero the statesman and orator. The eleven letters which precede the consulship are happily, from this point of view, addressed to Atticus. For it was to Atticus that he wrote with the least concealment, and with the confidence that any detail, however small, which concerned himself would be interesting to his correspondent. It is well, therefore, that, though we thus come into his life when it was more than half over, we should at once hear his genuine sentiments on whatever subjects he may be speaking. Besides his own, we have about ninety letters to Cicero from some of the chief men of the day—Pompey, Caesar, Cato, Brutus, Antony, and many others. They are of very various excellence. The best of them are by much less known men. Neither Pompey nor Caesar were good letter-writers, or, if the latter was so, he was too busy to use his powers. Cicero's position previous to the beginning of the Correspondence in B.C. 68. The letters begin, then, in B.C. 68, when Cicero was in his thirty-seventh year. He was already a man of established reputation both as a pleader and a writer. Rhetorical treatises (B.C. 86), translations from Xenophon and Plato (B.C. 84), and from the poems of Aratus (B.C. 81), had given evidence of a varied literary interest and a promise of future eminence, while his success as an advocate had led to the first step in the official cursus honorum by his becoming a quaestor Quaestor, B.C. 75. in B.C. 75. The lot assigned Lilybaeum as his sphere of work, and though the duties of a quaestor in Sicily were not such as to bring a man's name much before the Roman public, Cicero plumes himself, as was not unusual with him, on the integrity and energy which he displayed in his administration. He has indeed the honesty to tell against himself the story of the acquaintance who, meeting him at Puteoli on his return journey, asked him what day he had left Rome and what was the news there. When he answered rather crossly that he had just come from Sicily , another acquaintance put in with Why, of course. Didn't you know he has just been quaestor at Syracuse ? At any rate he had done sufficiently well in Lilybaeum to give him his next step, the aedileship to which he was elected B.C. 70, and to induce the Sicilians to apply to him, when in that year they desired the prosecution of the extortionate Verres. His energy and success in this business raised him, without question, to the first rank of advocates, and pledged him to a righteous policy in regard to the government of the provinces. Cicero's Boyhood and Education Still Cicero was a novus homo , and the jealous exclusiveness of the great families at Rome might yet prevent his attainment of the highest office of all. When the correspondence opens he is a candidate for the praetorship, which he obtained without difficulty, at the head of the poll. But his birth might still be a bar to the consulship. His father, M. Tullius, lived at Arpinum , an ancient city of the Volscians and afterwards of the Samnites, which had long enjoyed a partial, and from B.C. 188 a complete, Roman franchise, and was included in the Cornelian tribe. Cicero's mother's name was Helvia, of whom we know nothing but the one anecdote told by Quintus ( Fam. 16.26 ), who says that she used to seal the wine jars when they were emptied, so that none might be drained without her knowing it—a testimony to her economy and careful housewifery. His father had weak health and resided almost entirely in his villa at Arpinum , which he had considerably enlarged, much devoted to study and literature ( de Leg. 2.1 ). But though he apparently possessed considerable property, giving him equestrian rank, and though Cicero says that his family was very ancient, yet neither he nor any of his ancestors had held Roman magistracies. Marcus and his brother Quintus were the first of their family to do so, and both had to depend on character and ability to secure their elections. But though the father did nothing for his sons by holding curule office himself, he did the best for their education that was possible. Cicero calls him optimus et prudentissimus , and speaks with gratitude of what he had done for his sons in this respect. They were sent early to Rome to the house of C. Aculeo, a learned jurisconsult, married to a sister of Helvia; and attended—with their cousins, the sons of Aculeo—the best schools in the city ( De Orat. 2.1-2 ). The young Marcus showed extraordinary ability from the first, and that avidity for reading and study which never forsook him. As a young man he diligently attended the chambers of renowned jurisconsults, especially those of the elder and younger Scaevola, Crassus, and Antonius, and soon found that his calling in life was oratory. It was not till he was twenty-eight years old, however—when he had already written much and pleaded many cases—that he went on a visit of between two and three years to Greece , Asia , and Rhodes , to study in the various schools of rhetoric and philosophy, and to view their famous cities (B.C. 79—77). It was after his return from this tour that his age (he was now thirty-one) made the seeking of office at Rome possible From that time his election to the several offices—quaestorship, aedileship, praetorship, consulship—followed without any repulse, each in the first year of his age at which he was legally capable of being elected. He had doubtless made the acquaintance of Titus Pomponius, afterwards called Atticus, early in life. But it seems that it was their intimacy at Athens (B.C. 79), where Atticus, who was three years his senior, had been residing for several years, that began the very close and warm friendship which lasted with nothing but the slightest and most passing of clouds till his death. His brother Quintus was married to Pomponia, a sister of Atticus; but the marriage turned out unfortunately, and was a strain upon the friendship of Cicero and Atticus rather than an additional bond. This source of uneasiness meets us in the very first letter of the correspondence, and crops up again and again till the final rupture of the ill-assorted union by divorce in B.C. 44. Nothing, however, had apparently interrupted the correspondence of the two friends, which had been going on for a long time before the first letter which has been preserved. Cicero the successful Advocate. The eleven letters, then, which date before the consulship, show us Cicero in full career of success as an advocate and rising official, not as yet apparently much interested in party politics, but with his mind, in the intervals of forensic business, engaged on the adornment of the new villa at Tusculum , the first of the numerous country residences which his growing wealth or his heightened ideas of the dignity of his position prompted him to purchase. Atticus is commissioned to search in Athens and elsewhere for objects of art suitable for the residence of a wealthy Roman, who at the same time was a scholar and man of letters. He is beginning to feel the charm of at any rate a temporary retreat from the constant bustle and occupations of the city. Though Cicero loved Rome , and could hardly conceive of life unconnected with its business and excitements, 2 and eagerly looked for news of the city in his absence, yet there was another side to his character. His interest in literature and philosophy was quite as genuine as his interest in the forum and senate-house. When the season came for temporarily withdrawing from the latter, he returned to the former with eager passion. But Tusculum was too near Rome to secure him the quiet and solitude necessary for study and composition. Thus, though he says (vol. i., p.4), I am so delighted with my Tusculan villa that I never feel really happy till I get there, he often found it necessary, when engaged in any serious literary work, to seek the more complete retirement of Formiae , Cumae , or Pompeii , near all of which he acquired properties, besides an inheritance at Arpinum . 3 But the important achievements in literature were still in the future. The few letters of B.C. 68—67 are full of directions to Atticus for the collection of books or works of Death of Cicero's Father. art suitable to his house, and of matters of Death private interest. They are also short andsometimes abrupt. The famous allusion to his father's death in the second letter of this collection, contained in a single line— pater nobis decessit a . d . III Kal . Decembris —followed by directions to Atticus as to articles of vertu for his villa, has much exercised the minds of admirers, who do not like to think Cicero capable of such a cold-hearted sentence. It is certainly very unlike his usual manner. 4 He is more apt to exaggerate than understate his emotions; and in the first letter extant he speaks with real feeling of the death of a cousin. Elsewhere—as we have seen—he refers to his father with respect and gratitude. How then are we to account for such a cold announcement? Several expedients have been hit upon. First, to change decessit to discessit , and to refer the sentence to the father's quitting Rome , and not life; in which case it is not easy to see why the information is given at all. Second, to suppose it to be a mere answer to a request for the information on the part of Atticus; in which case the date must refer to some previous year, or the letter must be placed considerably later, to allow of time for Atticus to hear of the death and to write his question. In favour of the first is the fact that Asconius (§ 82) says that Cicero lost his father when he was a candidate for the consulship (B.C. 64). Some doubt has been thrown upon the genuineness of the passage in Asconius; and, if that is not trustworthy, we have nothing else to help us. On the whole I think we must leave the announcement as it stands in all its baldness. Cicero's father had long been an invalid, and Atticus may have been well aware that the end was expected. He would also be acquainted with the son's feelings towards his father, and Cicero may have held it unnecessary to enlarge upon them. It is possible, too, that he had already written to tell Atticus of the death and of his own feelings, but had omitted the date, which he here supplies. Whatever may be the true explanation—impossible now to recover—everything we know of Cicero forbids us to reckon insensibility among his faults, or reserve in expressing his feelings among his characteristics. The Praetorship, B.C. 66 In the next year (B.C. 67) we find Cicero elected to the praetorship, after at least two interruptions to the comitia , which, though not aimed at himself, gave him a foretaste of the political troubles to come a few years later. He is, however, at present simply annoyed at the inconvenience, not yet apprehensive of any harm to the constitution. The double postponement, indeed, had the effect of gratifying his vanity: for his own name was returned three times first of the list of eight. His praetorship (B.C. 66) passed without any startling event. The two somewhat meagre letters which remain belonging to this year tell us hardly anything. Still he began more or less to define his political position by advocating the lex Manilia , for putting the Mithridatic war into the hands of Pompey; and one of his most elaborate forensic speeches —that for Cluentius—was delivered in the course of the year: in which also his brother Quintus was elected to the aedileship. Preparations for the Consulship, B.C. 65—64 So far Cicero had risen steadily and without serious difficulty up the official ladder. But the stress was now to come. The old families seem not to have been so ready to oppose the rise of the novus homo to the praetorship. It was the consulship on which they tried to keep a tight hand. Accordingly, immediately after the year of his praetorship, we find him anxiously looking out for support and inquiring who are likely to be his competitors. The interesting point in regard to this is his connexion with Catiline. In his speech in the senate delivered in the following year ( in toga candida , B.C. 64) he denounced Catiline in the most violent language, accusing him of every conceivable crime; yet in B.C. 65 he not only contemplated being elected with him without any expression of disgust, but even considered whether he should not undertake his defence on some charge that was being brought against him—perhaps for his conduct during the Sullan proscriptions. To whitewash Catiline is a hopeless task; and it throws a lurid light upon the political and moral sentiments of the time to find Cicero even contemplating such a conjunction. After this, for two years, there is a break in the correspondence. Atticus had probably returned to Rome , and if there were letters to others (as no doubt there were) they have been lost. A certain light is thrown on the proceedings of the year of candidature (B.C. 64) by the essay On the duties of a candidate, ascribed to his brother Quintus, who was himself to be a candidate for the praetorship in the next year (B.C. 63). We may see from this essay that Pompey was still regarded as the greatest and most influential man at Rome ; that Catiline's character was so atrocious in the eyes of most, that his opposition was not to be feared; that Cicero's newness was a really formidable bar to his election, and that his chief support was to be looked for from the individuals and companies for whom he had acted as counsel, and who hoped to secure his services in the future. The support of the nobles was not a certainty. There had been a taint of popularity in some of Cicero's utterances, and the writer urges him to convince the consulars that he was at one with the Optimates, while at the same time aiming at the conciliation of the equestrian order. This was, in fact, to be Cicero's political position in the future. The party of the Optimates—in spite of his disgust at the indifference and frivolity of many of them—was to be his party: his favourite constitutional object was to be to keep the equites and the senate on good terms: and his greatest embarrassment was how to reconcile this position with his personal loyalty to Pompey, and his views as to the reforms necessary in the government of the provinces. The Consulship, B.C. 63. For the momentous year of the consulship we have no letters. His brother Quintus was in Rome as candidate and then praetor-designate; Atticus was also in Rome ; and the business, as well as the dignity of a consul, were against any thing like ordinary correspondence. Of the earlier part of the consulship we have little record. The speeches against Rullus were delivered at the beginning of the year, and commit Cicero pretty definitely to a policy as to the ager publicus —which was, to his disgust, entirely reversed by the triumvirs in B.C. 59—but they do not show any sense of coming trouble. Cicero, however, throughout his consulship took a very definite line against the populares . Not only did he defend Rabirius Postumus, when accused by Caesar of the assassination of Saturninus, and address the people against offering violence to L. Roscius on account of the unpopular lex theatralis but he even resisted the restoration to their civil rights of the sons of the men proscribed by Sulla, avowedly on the ground of the necessity of maintaining the established order, though he knew and confessed the justice of the proposal. 5 The Conspiracy of Catiline. Any movement, therefore, on the side of the popular party had now his opposition with which to reckon. He professes to have known very early in his year of office that some more than usually dangerous movement was in contemplation. We cannot well decide from the violent denunciation of Catiline contained—to judge from extant fragments—in the speech in toga candida , how far Cicero was really acquainted with any definite designs of his. Roman orators indulged in a violence of language so alien from modern ideas and habits, that it is difficult to draw definite conclusions. But it appears from Sallust that Catiline had, in a secret meeting before the elections of B.C. 64, professed an intention of going all lengths in a revolutionary programme and, if that was the case, Cicero would be sure to have had some secret information on the subject. But his hands were partly tied by the fact that the comitia had given him a colleague-C. Antonius- deeply implicated in Catiline's policy, whatever it was. Pompey, whom he regarded as the champion of law and order, was in the East: and Catiline's candidature—and it was supposed his policy also—had had the almost open support of the richest man in Rome , M. Licinius Crassus, and of the most influential man of the populares , C. Iulius Caesar. In the house of one or the other of them, indeed, the meeting at which Catiline first unfolded his purposes was believed to have been held. Still Catiline had not been guilty of any overt act which enabled Cicero to attack him. He had, indeed, been informed, on very questionable authority, that Catiline had made a plot to assassinate him while holding the elections, and he made a considerable parade of taking precautions for his safety—letting it be seen that he wore a cuirass under his toga, and causing his house to be guarded by the younger members of his party. The elections, according to Plutarch, had at least been once postponed from the ordinary time in July, though this has been denied. 6 At any rate it was not till they had taken place and Catiline had been once more rejected, that any definite step is alleged to have been taken by him, such as Cicero could lay hold of to attack him. On the 20th of October, in the senate, Cicero made a speech warning the Fathers of the impending danger, and on the 21st called upon Catiline for an explanation in their presence. But, after all, even the famous meeting of the 5th of November, in the house of M. Porcius Laeca, betrayed to Cicero by Fulvia, the mistress of Q. Curius, would not have sufficed as grounds for the denunciation of the first extant speech against Catiline (7th of November), if it had not been for something else. For some months past there had been rumours of risings in various parts of Italy ; but by the beginning of November it was known that C. Manlius (or Mallius) had collected a band of desperadoes near Faesulae , and, having established there a camp on the 27th of October, meant to advance on Rome . Manlius had been a centurion in Sulla's army, and had received an allotment of confiscated land in Etruria; but, like others, had failed to prosper. The movement was one born of discontent with embarrassments which were mostly brought about by extravagance or incompetence. But the rapidity with which Manlius was able to gather a formidable force round him seems to show that there were genuine grievances also affecting the agricultural classes in Etruria generally. At any rate there was now no doubt that a formidable disturbance was brewing; the senate voted that there was a tumultus , authorized the raising of troops, and named commanders in the several districts affected. It was complicity in this rising that Cicero now sought to establish against Catiline and his partisans in Rome . The report of the meeting in the house of Laeca gave him the pretext for his first step—a fiery denunciation of Catiline in the senate on the 7th of November. Catiline left Rome , joined the camp of Manlius, and assumed the ensigns of imperium . That he was allowed thus to leave the city is a proof that Cicero had as yet no information enabling him to act at once. It was the right of every citizen to avoid standing a trial by going into exile. Catiline was now under notice of prosecution for vis , and when leaving Rome he professed to be going to Marseilles , which had the jus exilii . But when it was known that he had stopped short at Faesulae the senate at once declared both him and Manlius hostes , and authorized the consuls to proceed against them. The expedition was intrusted to Antonius, in spite of his known sympathy with Catiline, while Cicero was retained with special powers to protect the city. The result is too well known to be more than glanced at here. Catiline's partisans were detected by letters confided to certain envoys of the Allobroges, which were held to convict them of the guilt of treason, as instigating Catiline to march on Rome , and the senate of the Allobroges to assist the invasion by sending Cavalry to Faesulae . Execution of he conspirators, December, B.C. 63. Its legal grounds and consequences. The decree of the senate, videant consules , etc . , had come to be considered as reviving the full imperium of the consul, and investing him with the power of life and death over all citizens. Cicero acted on this (questionable) constitutional doctrine. He endeavoured, indeed, to shelter himself under the authority of a senatorial vote. But the senate never had the power to try or condemn a citizen. It could only record its advice to the consul. The whole legal responsibility for the condemnation and death of the conspirators, arrested in consequence of these letters, rested on the consul. To our moral judgment as to Cicero's conduct it is of primary importance to determine whether or not these men were guilty: to his legal and constitutional position it matters not at all. Nor was that point ever raised against him. The whole question turns on whether the doctrine was true that the senatus consultum ultimum gave the consul the right of inflicting death upon citizens without trial, i.e., without appeal to the people, on the analogy of the dictator seditionis sedandae causa , thus practically defeating that most ancient and cherished safeguard of Roman liberty, the ius provocationis . The precedents were few, and scarcely such as would appeal to popular approval. The murder of Tiberius Gracchus had been ex post facto approved by the senate in B.C. 133—2. In the case of Gaius Gracchus, in B.C. 121, the senate had voted uti consul Opimius rempublicam defenderet , and in virtue of that the consul had authorized the killing of Gaius and his friends: thus for the first time exercising imperium sine provocatione . Opimius had been impeached after his year of office, but acquitted, which the senate might claim as a confirmation of the right, in spite of the lex of Gaius Gracchus, which confirmed the right of provocatio in all cases. In B.C. 100 the tribune Saturninus and the praetor Glaucia were arrested in consequence of a similar decree, which this time joined the other magistrates to the consuls as authorized to protect the Republic: their death, however, was an act of violence on the part of a mob. Its legality had been impugned by Caesar's condemnation of Rabirius, as duovir capitalis , but to a certain extent confirmed by the failure to secure his conviction on the trial of his appeal to the people. In B.C. 88 and 83 this decree of the senate was again passed, in the first case in favour of Sulla against the tribune Sulpicius, who was in consequence put to death; and in the second case in favour of the consuls (partisans of Marius) against the followers of Sulla. Again in B.C. 77 the decree was passed in consequence of the insurrection of the proconsul Lepidus, who, however, escaped to Sardinia and died there. In every case but one this decree had been passed against the popular party. The only legal sanction given to the exercise of the imperium sine provocatione was the acquittal of the consul Opimius in B.C. 120. But the jury which tried that case probably consisted entirely of senators, who would not stultify their own proceedings by condemning him. To rely upon such precedents required either great boldness (never a characteristic of Cicero ), or the most profound conviction of the essential righteousness of the measure, and the clearest assurance that the safety of the state—the supreme law—justified the breach of every constitutional principle. Cicero was not left long in doubt as to whether there would be any to question his proceeding. On the last day of the year, when about to address the people, as was customary, on laying down his consulship, the tribune Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos forbade him to speak, on the express ground that he had put citizens to death uncondemned — quod cives indemnatos necavisset . Cicero consoled himself with taking the required oath as to having observed the laws, with an additional declaration that he had saved the state. Nevertheless, he must have felt deeply annoyed and alarmed at the action of Metellus, for he had been a legatus of Pompey, and was supposed to represent his views, and it was upon the approbation and support of Pompey, now on the eve of his return from the East, that Cicero particularly reckoned. Letters after B. C. 63. The letters in our collection now recommence. The first of the year (B.C. 62) is one addressed to Pompey, expressing some discontent at the qualified manner in which he had written on recent events, and affirming his own conviction that he had acted in the best interests of the state and with universal approval. But indeed the whole correspondence to the end of Cicero's exile is permeated with this subject directly or indirectly. His quarrel with Metellus Nepos brought upon him a remonstrance from the latter's brother (or cousin), Metellus Celer (Letters XIII, XIV), and when the correspondence for B.C. 61 opens, we find him already on the eve of the quarrel with Publius Clodius which was to bring upon him the exile of B.C. 58. Publius Clodius Pulcher. P. CLODIUS PULCHER was an extreme instance of a character not uncommon among the nobility in the last age of the Republic. Of high birth, and possessed of no small amount of ability and energy, he belonged by origin and connexion to the Optimates; but he regarded politics as a game to be played for his personal aggrandizement, and public office as a means of replenishing a purse drained by boundless extravagance and self-indulgence. His record had been bad. He had accompanied his brother-in-law Lucullus, or had joined his staff, in the war with Mithridates, and had helped to excite a mutiny in his army in revenge for some fancied slight. He had then gone to Cilicia , where another brother-in-law, Q. Marcus Rex, was propraetor, and while commanding a fleet under him had fallen into the hands of pirates, and when freed from them had gone—apparently in a private capacity—to Antioch , where he again excited a mutiny of Syrian troops engaged in a war against the Arabians (B.C. 70—65). On his return to Rome he attempted to make himself conspicuous by prosecuting Catiline, but accepted a bribe to withdraw. In B.C. 64, on the staff of the governor of Gallia Narbonensis , he is accused of having enriched himself with plunder. For a time after that he was still acting as a member of the party of the Optimates; seems to have supported Cicero during the Catiline conspiracy; and in B.C. 62 stood for the quaestorship and was elected. His violation of the mysteries was alleged to have been committed in December of that year, and before he could go to the province allotted to him as quaestor in Sicily he had to stand a trial for sacrilege. Such an offence—penetrating in disguise into the house of the Pontifex Maximus, when his wife was engaged in the secret rites of the Bona Dea—would place him under a curse, and not only prevent his entering upon his quaestorship, but would disfranchise and politically ruin him. Clodius would seem not to have been a person of sufficient character or importance to make this trial a political event. But not only had he powerful backers, but his opponents also, by proposing an innovation in the manner of selecting the jurors for trying him, had managed to give a spurious political importance to the case. One of the most brilliant of the early letters (XV, p.37) gives us a graphic picture of the trial. Clodius was acquitted and went to his province, but returned in B.C. 60, apparently prepared for a change of parties. Cicero and he had quarreled over the trial. He had said sarcastic things about the sacred consulship, and Cicero had retaliated by bitter speeches in the senate, and by giving evidence at the trial of having seen Clodius in Rome three hours before he professed to have been at Interamna , on the day of the alleged sacrilege. It is perhaps possible that his alibi may have been true in substance, for he may have been well out of Rome on his way to Interamna after seeing Cicero. But, however that may be, he nourished a grudge against Cicero, which he presently had an opportunity of satisfying. The year of his return to Rome from Sicily (B.C. 60) was the same as that of Caesar's return from Spain . Pompey—who had returned the year before—was at enmity with the senate on account of the difficulties raised to the confirmation of his acta and the allotments for his veterans. Caesar had a grievance because of the difficulties put in the way of his triumph. The two coalesced, taking in the millionaire Crassus, to form a triumvirate or coalition of three, with a view to getting measures they desired passed, and offices for themselves or their partisans. This was a great blow to Cicero, who clung feverously to Pompey as a political leader, but could not follow him in a coalition with Caesar: for he knew that the object of it was a series of measures of which he heartily disapproved. His hope of seeing Pompey coming to act as acknowledged leader of the Optimates was dashed to the ground. He could not make up his mind wholly to abandon him, or, on the other hand, to cut himself adrift from the party of Optimates, to whose policy he had so deeply committed himself. Clodius was troubled by no such scruples. Perhaps Caesar had given him substantial reasons for his change of policy. At any rate, from this time forward he acts as an extreme popularis —much too extreme, as it turned out, for Pompey's taste. As a patrician his next step in the official ladder would naturally have been the aedileship. But that peaceful office did not suit his present purpose. The tribuneship would give him the right to bring forward measures in the comitia tributa , such as he desired to pass, and would in particular give him the opportunity of attacking Cicero. The difficulty was that to become tribune he must cease to be a patrician. He could only do that by being adopted into a plebeian gens. He had a plebeian ready to do it in B.C. 59. But for a man who was sui iuris to be adopted required a formal meeting of the old comitia curiata , and such a meeting required the presence of an augur, as well as some kind of sanction of the pontifices. Caesar was Pontifex Maximus, and Pompey was a member of the college of augurs. Their influence would be sufficient to secure or prevent this being done. Their consent was, it appears, for a time withheld. But Caesar was going to Gaul at the end of his consulship, and desired to have as few powerful enemies at Rome during his absence as possible. Still he had a personal feeling for Cicero, and when it was known that one of Clodius's objects in seeking to become a plebeian and a tribune was to attack him, Caesar offered him two chances of honourable retreat—first as one of the commissioners to administer his land law, and again as one of his legati in Gaul . But Cicero would not accept the first, because he was vehemently opposed to the law itself: nor the second, because he had no taste for provincial business, even supposing the proconsul to be to his liking; and because he could not believe that P. Clodius would venture to attack him, or would succeed if he did. Caesar's consulship of B.C. 59 roused his worst fears for the Republic; and, though he thought little of the statesmanship or good sense of Caesar's hostile colleague Bibulus, he was thoroughly disgusted with the policy of the triumvirs, with the contemptuous treatment of the senate, with the highhanded disregard of the auspices—by means of which Bibulus tried to invalidate the laws and other acta of Caesar—and with the armed forces which Pompey brought into the campus , nominally to keep order, but really to overawe the comitia , and secure the passing of Caesar's laws. Nor was it in his nature to conceal his feelings. Speaking early in the year in defence of his former colleague, C. Antonius, accused of maiestas for his conduct in Macedonia , he expressed in no doubtful terms his view of the political situation. Within a few hours the words were reported to the triumvirs, and all formalities were promptly gone through for the adoption of Clodius. Caesar himself presided at the comitia curiata , Pompey attended as augur, and the thing was done in a few minutes. Even then Cicero does not appear to have been alarmed, or to have been fully aware of what the object of Publius was. While on his usual spring visit to his seaside villas in April (B.C. 59), he expressed surprise at hearing from the young Curio that Clodius was a candidate for the tribuneship (vol. i., p.99). His surprise no doubt was more or less assumed: he must have understood that Clodius's object in the adoption was the tribunate, and must have had many uneasy reflexions as to the use which he would make of the office when he got it. Indeed there was not very much doubt about it, for Publius openly avowed his intentions. We have accordingly numerous references, in the letters to Atticus, to Cicero's doubts about the course he ought to adopt. Should he accept Caesar's offer of a legation in Gaul , or a free and votive legation? Should he stay in Rome and fight it out? The latter course was the one on which he was still resolved in July, when Clodius had been, or was on the point of being, elected tribune (p. 110). He afterwards wavered (p.113), but was encouraged by the belief that all the orders were favourable to him, and were becoming alienated from the triumvirs (pp. 117, 119), especially after the affair of Vettius (pp.122-124), and by the friendly disposition of many of the colleagues of Clodius in the tribuneship. With such feelings of confidence and courage the letters of B.C. 59 come to an end. The Exile, April, B. C. 58-August, B. C. 57. The correspondence only opens again in April of B.C. 58, when the worst has happened. Clodius entered upon his tribuneship on the 10th of December, B.C. 59, and lost little time in proposing a law to the comitia for the trial of any magistrate guilty of putting citizens to death without trial ( qui cives indemnatos necavisset ). The wording of the law thus left it open to plead that it applied only to such act as occurred after its enactment, for the pluperfect necavisset in the dependent clause answers to the future perfect in a direct one. And this was the interpretation that Caesar, while approving the law itself, desired to put upon it. 7 He again offered Cicero a legation in Gaul , but would do nothing for him if he stayed in Rome ; while Pompey, who had been profuse in promises of protection, either avoided seeing Cicero, or treated his abject entreaties with cold disdain. 8 Every citizen, by a humane custom at Rome , had the right of avoiding a prosecution by quitting the city and residing in some town which had the ius exilii . It is this course that we find Cicero already entered upon when the correspondence of the year begins. In the letters of this year of exile he continually reproaches himself with not having stayed and even supported the law, in full confidence that it could not be applied to himself. He attributes his having taken the less courageous course to the advice of his friends, who were actuated by jealousy and a desire to get rid of him. Even Atticus he thinks was timid, at the best, in advising his retirement. It is the only occasion in all the correspondence in which the least cloud seems to have rested on the perfect friendship of the two men. Atticus does not appear to have shown any annoyance at the querulous remarks of his friend. He steadily continued to write, giving information and advice, and made no difficulty in supplying his friend with money. During Cicero's absence Atticus became still more wealthy than before by inheriting the estates of his cross-grained uncle Caecilius. But he was always careful as to the investment of his money and he would not, perhaps, have been so ready to trust Cicero, had he not felt confidence in the ultimate recovery of his civil status. Still his confidence was peculiarly welcome at a time which would have been otherwise one of great pressure. For Clodius had followed up Cicero's retirement with the usual lex in regard to persons leaving Rome to avoid a trial—a prohibition of fire and water within a fixed distance from Italy , which involved the confiscation of all his property in Italy . His villas were dismantled, his town house pulled down, and a vote of the people obtained by Clodius for the consecration of its site as a templum dedicated to Liberty, and a scheme was formed and the work actually commenced for occupying part of it by an extension of an existing porticus or colonnade (the porticus Catuli ) to contain a statue of Liberty. That this consecration was regular is shown by the pleas by which it was afterwards sought to reverse it. 9 When Cicero was recalled the question came before the pontifices, who decided that the consecration was not valid unless it had been done by the order of the people. It could not be denied on the face of it that there had been such an order. Cicero was obliged to resort to the plea that Clodius's adoption had been irregular and invalid, that therefore he was not legally a tribune, and could not take an order of the people. Finally, the senate seems to have decided that its restoration to Cicero was part of the general restitutio in integrum voted by the comitia centuriata ; and a sum of money was assigned to him for the rebuilding of the house. Clodius refused to recognize the validity of this decree of the senate, and attempted by violence to interrupt the workmen engaged on the house. We have a lively picture of this in Letter XCI (vol. i., pp. 194-196). Letters of the Exile (Letters LV-LXXXVIII). The letters from Cicero as an exile are painful reading for those who entertain a regard for his character. It was not unnatural, indeed, that he should feel it grievously. He had so completely convinced himself of the extraordinary value of his services to the state, of the importance of his position in Roman politics, and of the view that the Optimates would take of the necessity of retaining him, that to see himself treated like a fraudulent or unsuccessful provincial governor, of no importance to anyone but himself, was a bitter blow to his self-esteem. The actual loss was immense. His only means were now the amount of money he had been able to take with him, or was able to borrow. All was gone except such property as his wife retained in her own right. He was a dependent upon her, instead of being her support and the master of his own household. The services of freedmen—readily rendered when he was prosperous—would now be a matter of favour and personal attachment, which was not always sufficient to retain them. The life and light of the city, in which no man ever took a more eager interest and delight, were closed to him. He was cut off from his family, and from familiar intercourse with friends, on both of which he was much dependent for personal happiness. Lastly, wherever he lived, he lived, as it were, on sufferance, no longer an object of respect as a statesman, or the source of help to others by his eloquence. But, disagreeable as all this was to a man of Cicero's sensitive vanity, there was something still worse. Even in towns which were the legal distance from Italy he could not safely stay, if they were within the jurisdiction of one of his personal enemies, or contained other exiles, who owed him an ill turn. He was protected by no law, and more than one instance of such a man's falling a victim to an enemy's dagger is recorded. Cicero's first idea was to go to Malta : but Malta was for some purposes in the jurisdiction of the governor of Sicily , and the governor of Sicily (C. Vergilius) 10 objected to his passing through Sicily or staying at Malta . We have no reason for supposing Vergilius personally hostile to Cicero, but he may have thought that Cicero's services to the Sicilians in the Case of Verres would have called out some expression of feeling on their part in his favour, which would have been awkward for a Roman governor. Cicero therefore crossed to Epirus , and travelled down the Egnatian road to Thessalonica . This was the official capital of the province of Macedonia , and the quaestor in Macedonia , Gnaeus Plancius, met Cicero at Dyrrachium , invited him to fix his residence there with him, and accompanied him on his journey. Here he stayed till November in a state of anxiety and distress, faithfully reflected in his letters, waiting to hear how far the elections for B.C. 57 would result in putting his friends in office, and watching for any political changes that would favour his recall: but prepared to go still farther to Cyzicus , if the incoming governor, L. Calpurnius Piso, who, as consul in B.C. 58 with Gabinius, had shown decided animus against him, should still retain that feeling in Macedonia . Events, however, in Rome during the summer and autumn of B.C. 58 gave him better hopes. Clodius, by his violent proceedings, as well as by his legislation, had alienated Pompey, and caused him to favour Cicero's recall. Of the new consuls Lentulus was his friend, and Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos (who as tribune in B.C. 63—62 had prevented his speech when laying down his consulship) consented to waive all opposition. A majority of the new tribunes were also favourable to him, especially P. Sestius and T. Annius Milo; and in spite of constant ups and downs in his feelings of confidence, he had on the whole concluded that his recall was certain to take place. Towards the end of November he therefore travelled back to Dyrrachium , a libera civitas in which he had many friends, and where he thought he might be safe, and from which he could cross to Italy as soon as he heard of the law for his recall having been passed. Here, however, he was kept waiting through many months of anxiety. Clodius had managed to make his recall as difficult as possible. He had, while tribune, obtained an order from the people forbidding the consuls to bring the subject before the senate, and Piso and Gabinius had during their year of office pleaded that law as a bar to introducing the question. The Recall, August, B. C. 57. The new consuls were not, or did not consider themselves, so bound, and Lentulus having brought the subject forward, the senate early passed a resolution that Cicero's recall was to take precedence of all other business. In accordance with the resolution of the senate, a law was proposed by the consul Lentulus in the comitia centuriata , and probably one by Milo to the tributa . But Clodius, though no longer armed with the tribuneship, was not yet beaten. He obtained the aid of some gladiators belonging to his brother Appius, and more than once interrupted and dispersed an assembly of the comitia . In the riots thus occasioned blood was shed on both sides, and Cicero's brother Quintus on one occasion nearly lost his life. This was the beginning of the series of violent contests between Clodius and Milo, only ended by the murder of the former on the Appian road in B.C. 52. But Clodius was a candidate for the aedileship in this year (B.C. 57), and could be barred from that office legally by a prosecution for vis , of which Milo gave notice against him. It was, perhaps, a desire to avoid this, as much as fear of Milo's counter exhibition of violence, that at length caused him to relax in his opposition, or at any rate to abstain from violently interrupting the comitia . Accordingly, on the 4th of August, the law proposed by both consuls, and supported by Pompey, was passed unanimously by the centuries. Cicero, we must presume, had received trustworthy information that this was to be the case (showing that some understanding had been come to with Clodius, or there would have been no certainty of his not violently dispersing the comitia again), for on that same day he set sail from Dyrrachium and landed at Brundisium on the 5th. His triumphant return to Rome is described in the eighty-ninth letter of this collection. For Pompey's share in securing it he expressed, and seems really to have felt, an exaggerated gratitude, which still influenced him in the unhappy months of B.C. 49, when he was hesitating as to joining him beyond seas in the civil war. But though Clodius had somehow been prevented from hindering his recall, he by no means relaxed his hostility. He not only tried to excite the populace against him by arguing that the scarcity and consequent high price of corn, from which the people were at that time suffering, was in some way attributable to Cicero's policy, but he also opposed the restoration of his house; and when a decree of the senate was passed in Cicero's favour on that point, brought his armed ruffians to prevent the workmen from going on with the rebuilding, as well as to molest Cicero himself (vol. i., p.195). This was followed by a determined opposition by Milo to the holding of the elections for B.C. 56, until his prosecution of Clodius de vi should have been tried. Clodius, however, was acquitted 11 , and, being elected aedile, immediately commenced a counter accusation against Milo for vis . He impeached him before the comitia in February (B.C. 56), on which occasion Pompey spoke in Milo's defence in the midst of a storm of interruptions got up by the friends of Clodius (vol. i., pp.214, 217). Milo was also acquitted, and the rest of Clodius's aedileship seems to have passed without farther acts of open violence. Cicero and the Triumvirs. But Cicero had now other causes of anxiety. He had spoken in favour of the commission offered to Pompey in B.C. 57 for superintending the corn-supply of Rome ( cura annonae ). Pompey was to have fifteen legates, a good supply of ships and men, and considerable powers in all corn-growing countries in the Mediterranean. Cicero supported this, partly from gratitude to Pompey, but partly also from a wish to promote his power and influence against the ever-increasing influence and fame of Caesar. He secretly hoped that a jealousy might grow up between them; that Pompey would be drawn closer to the Optimates; and that the union of the triumvirate might be gradually weakened and finally disappear. Pompey was thoroughly offended and alarmed by the insults offered him by the Clodian mob, and by Clodius's own denunciations of him; and if he could be convinced that these were suggested or approved by Caesar or Crassus, it would go far to withdraw him from friendship with either of them. With Crassus, indeed, he had never been on cordial terms: it was only Caesar's influence that had caused him to form any union with him. Caesar, on the other hand, was likely to be uneasy at the great powers which the cura annonae put into Pompey's hands; and at the possible suggestion of offering him the dictatorship, if the Clodian riots became quite intolerable. On the whole, Cicero thought that he saw the element of a very pretty quarrel, from which he hoped that the result might be liberty the orderly working of the constitution, that is, without the irregular supremacy of anyone, at any rate of anyone of the popular party. He had, however, a delicate part to play. He did not wish or dare to break openly with Caesar, or to speak too openly to Pompey; and he was conscious that the intemperance, folly, or indifference of many of the Optimates made it difficult to reckon on their support, and made that support a very questionable benefit if accorded. But though his letters of this period are full of expressions indicating doubt of Pompey and irritation with him, yet he seems still to have spoken of him with warmth on public occasions, while he avoided mentioning Caesar, or spoke of him only in cold terms. Renewal of the Triumvirate at Luca , April, B.C. 56, and Cicero's change of policy. The hope, however, of detaching Pompey from Caesar was dashed by the meeting at Luca in April,B.C. 56, at which a fresh arrangement was made for the mutual advantage of the triumvirs. Caesar got the promise of the introduction of a law giving him an additional five years of command in Gaul , with special privileges as to his candidature for the consulship of B.C. 48; while Pompey and Crassus bargained for a second consulship in B.C. 55, and the reversion of the Spains (to be held as a single province) and Syria respectively, each for five years. The care taken that none of the three should have imperium overlapping that of the others was indeed a sign of mutual distrust and jealousy. But the bargain was made with sufficient approval of the members of the party crowding Luca to secure its being carried out by the comitia. The union seemed stronger than ever; and Cicero at length resolved on a great change of attitude. Opposition to the triumvirs had been abandoned, he saw, by the very party for whom he had been incurring the enmity of Pompey and Caesar. Why should he hold out any longer? Since those who have no power, he writes to Atticus in April, refuse me their affection, let me take care to secure the affection of those who have power. You will say, 'I could have wished that you had done so before.' I know you did wish it, and that I have made a real ass of myself. 12 This is the first indication in the letters of the change. But it was soon to be publicly avowed. The opposition to the consulship of Pompey and Crassus was so violent that no election took place during B.C. 56, and they were only elected under the presidency of interreges at the beginning of February, B.C. 55. But by the lex Sempronia the senate was bound to name the consular provinces—i.e., the provinces to be governed by the incoming consuls after their year of office—before the elections, and in his speech on the subject (be Provinciis Consularibus ), delivered apparently in July, B.C. 56, Cicero, while urging that Piso and Gabinius should have successors appointed to them in Macedonia and Syria , took occasion to announce and defend his own reconciliation with Caesar, and to support his continuance in the governorship of Gaul . Shortly afterwards, when defending the citizenship of L. Cornelius Balbus, he delivered a glowing panegyric on Pompey's character and services to the state. This was followed by a complete abstention from any farther opposition to the carrying out of Caesar's law for the allotment of the Campanian land—a subject which he had himself brought before the senate only a short time before, and on which he really continued to feel strongly. 13 Cicero's most elaborate defence of his change of front is contained in a long letter to P. Lentulus Spinther, written two years afterwards. 14 The gist of it is much the same as the remark to Atticus already quoted. Pompey and Caesar were all-powerful, and could not be resisted without civil violence, if not downright civil war. The Optimates were feeble and shifty, had shown ingratitude to Cicero himself, and had openly favoured his enemy Clodius. Public peace and safety must be the statesman's chief object, and almost any concession was to be preferred to endangering these. Nevertheless, we cannot think that Cicero was ever heartily reconciled to the policy, or the unconstitutional preponderance of the triumvirs. He patched up some sort of reconciliation with Crassus, and his personal affection for Pompey made it comparatively easy for him to give him a kind of support. Caesar was away, and a correspondence filled on both sides with courteous expressions could be maintained without seriously compromising his convictions. But Cicero was never easy under the yoke. From B.C. 55 to B.C. 52 he sought several opportunities for a prolonged stay in the country, devoting himself—in default of politics—to literature. The fruits of this were the de Oratore and the de Republica, besides poems on his own times and on his consulship. Still he was obliged from time to time to appear in the forum and senate-house, and in various ways to gratify Pompey and Caesar. It must have been a great strain upon his loyalty to this new political friendship when, in B.C. 54, Pompey called upon him to undertake the defence of P. Vatinius, whom he had not long before attacked so fiercely while defending Sestius. Vatinius had been a tribune in B.C. 59, acting entirely in Caesar's interests, and Cicero believed him to have been his enemy both in the matter of his exile and in the opposition to his recall. He had denounced him in terms that would have made it almost impossible, one would think, to have spoken in his defence in any cause whatever. At best he represented all that Cicero most disliked in politics; and on this very election, to the praetorship, for which he was charged with bribery ( de sodalitiis ), Cicero had already spoken in strongly hostile terms in the senate. For now undertaking his defence he has, in fact, no explanation to give to Lentulus (vol. i., p.319), and he was long sore at having been forced to do it. Through B.C. 54 and 53 he was busied with his de Republica, and was kept more in touch with Caesar by the fact that his brother Quintus was serving as legatus to the latter in Britain and Gaul , and that his Quintus Cicero in Gaul . friend Trebatius (introduced by himself) was seeking for promotion and profit in Caesar's camp. But even his brother's service with Caesar did not eventually contribute to the formation of cordial feeling on his part towards Caesar, whom he could not help admiring, but never really liked. For Quintus, though he distinguished himself by his defence of his camp in the autumn of B.C. 54, lost credit and subjected himself to grave rebuke by the disaster incurred in B.C. 53, near Aduatuca ( Tongres ), brought about by disregarding an express order of Caesar's. There is no allusion to this in the extant correspondence, but a fragment of letter from Caesar to Cicero (neque pro cauto ac diligente se castris continuit 15 ), seems to show that Caesar had written sharply to Cicero on his brother's faux pas, and after this time, though Cicero met Caesar at Ravenna in B.C. 52, and consented to support the bill allowing him to stand for the consulship in his absence, 16 there is apparent in his references to him a return to the cold or critical tone of former times. But of course there were other reasons. Pompey's third consulship and the trial of Milo, B.C. 52. Pompey's six months' sole consulship of B.C. 52 ( that divine third consulship ), the rumour of his dictatorship, and the growing determination of the Optimates to play off Pompey against Caesar (Crassus having disappeared) and to insist on Caesar resigning his province and army before the end of his ten years' tenure, and before standing for a second consulship, caused Cicero's hope of a final dissolution of the unconstitutional compact to revive again; and made him draw more and more closely to Pompey as the chief hope of the boni. In the beginning of the year he had found himself in opposition, or quasi-opposition, to Pompey in regard to the prosecution of Milo for the murder of Clodius. But though in the previous year he had declared that the election of Milo to the consulship was of the utmost importance to his own position and the safety of the state, 17 now that it was rendered impossible by Milo's condemnation, he seems to have placed all his hopes on Pompey. Unfortunately, there is here a break in the correspondence. There is no letter of the last six months of B.C. 53, and only four (perhaps only three) of B.C. 52. 18 So that the riots which prevented Milo's election, the death of Clodius and the riots following it, and the consequent sole consulship of Pompey, with the latter's new legislation and the trial of Milo—all have to be sought for elsewhere. The last letter of this volume and of this year, addressed to M. Marius in December, B.C. 52, alludes to the condemnation of Milo, and to the numerous prosecutions following it. Here, in Rome , I am so distracted by the number of trials, the crowded Courts, and the new legislation, that I daily offer prayers that there may be no intercalation. 19 Cicero appointed Proconsul of Cilicia , B.C. 51—50. When the correspondence opens again in the spring of B.C. 51 an event has happened, of no particular importance in itself, but of supreme interest to Cicero, and very fortunate for the readers of the correspondence. One of Pompey's new laws ordained that no one was to take a province till the fifth year after laying down his consulship or praetorship. Pompey broke his own law by keeping his province, the Spains—his position in regard to them was altogether exceptional—but, in order to carry out the law in other cases, the senate arranged that ex-consuls and ex-praetors who had not been to provinces should in turn draw lots for vacant governorships. Cicero and Bibulus appear to have been the senior consulares in that position, and with much reluctance Cicero allowed his name to be cast into the urn. He drew Cilicia and Bibulus Syria. He says that his motive was a desire to obey the wishes of the senate. Another motive may have been a desire to be away from Rome while the controversy as to Caesar's retirement from his province was settled, and to retrieve a position of some political importance, which he had certainly not increased during the last few years. When it came to the actual start, however, he felt all the gêne of the business—the formation and control of his staff, the separation from friends, and the residence far from the light and life of Rome , among officials who were certainly commonplace and probably corrupt, and amidst a population, perhaps acute and accomplished, but certainly servile and ill content, and in some parts predatory and barbarous. At the best, they would be emphatically provincial, in a dreary sense of the word. He felt unequal to the worry and bore of the whole business, and reproached himself with the folly of the undertaking. Of course, this regret is mingled with his usual self-congratulation on the purity with which he means to manage his province. But even that feeling is not strong enough to prevent his longing earnestly to have the period of banishment as short as possible, or to prevent the alarm with which he hears of a probable invasion by the Parthians. One effect of his almost two years' absence from Rome was, I think, to deprive him of the power of judging clearly of the course of events. He had constant intelligence and excellent correspondents—especially Caelius—still he could not really grasp what was going on under the surface: and when he returned to find the civil war on the point of breaking out, he was, after all, taken by surprise, and had no plan of action ready. This, as well as his government of the province, will be fully illustrated in the next volume of the correspondence. Cicero's Correspondents. The persons to whom the chief letters are addressed in this volume, besides Atticus, are Cicero's brother Quintus and P. Lentulus Spinther. There are two excellent letters to M. Marius, and one very interesting, though rather surprising, epistle to L. Lucceius. Others of more than average interest are to Terentia, M. Fadius Gallus, C. Scribonius Curio, and Tiro. ATTICUS (B.C. 109—32) is a man of whom we should be glad to know more than we do. He was the Titus Pomponius Atticus. friend of all the leading men of the day— Pompey, Caesar, Cicero, Antony, Brutus—father-in-law of Agrippa, and survived to be a constant correspondent of Augustus, between B.C. 43 and his death in B.C. 32. He was spared and respected by both sides in the civil wars, from Sulla to the Second Triumvirate. The secret of his success seems to have been that he was no man's rival. He resolutely declined all official employment, even on the staff of his brother-in-law Quintus Cicero. He committed himself to no side in politics, and, not being in the senate, had no occasion by vote or speech to wound the feelings of anyone. So, too, though he cared for literature, it was rather as a friendly critic of others than as an author. He did, it is true, compile some books on Roman history, on historical portraits, and certain family biographies; but they were not such as made him a rival of any of his Contemporaries. They were rather the productions of a rich amateur, who had leisure to indulge a quasi-literary taste, without any thought of joining the ranks of professed writers. Thirdly, he had great wealth, partly inherited, partly acquired by prudent speculation in the purchase of town properties, or in loans to states or public bodies on fair terms: and this wealth was at the service of his friends, but not in the lavish or reckless manner, which often earns only ingratitude without being of any permanent service to the recipients. He lent money, but expected to be repaid even by his brother-in-law. And this prudence helped to retain the confidence, while his sympathetic temperament secured the liking, of most. Again, he had the valuable knack of constantly replenishing the number of his friends among men junior to himself. His character attracted the liking of Sulla, who was twenty-seven years his senior, and he remained the close friend of his contemporaries Hortensius and Cicero (the former five years his senior, the latter three years his junior) till the day of their death. But we also find him on intimate terms with Brutus, twenty-four, and Octavian, forty-six years junior to himself. Lastly, he was not too much at Rome . More than twenty years of his earlier manhood (B.C. 87—65) were spent in Greece , principally at Athens , partly in study and partly in business. And Athens at this time, long deprived of political importance, had still the charm not only of its illustrious past, but also of its surviving character as the home of culture and refinement. When he at length returned to Rome in B.C. 65, he had already purchased a property in Epirus , near Buthrotum (see p.3), where he built a villa, in which he continued to spend a considerable part of his remaining years. This was sufficiently remote, not only from Rome , but from the summer residences of the Roman nobles, to secure his isolation from the intrigues and enmities of Roman society. He did not indeed—as who does ?—always escape giving offence. At the very beginning of the correspondence we hear of his vain attempts to mollify the anger of L. Lucceius—how incurred we do not know; and Quintus Cicero, of whose sharp temper we hear so much, was on more than one occasion on the point of a rupture with him. But his family life was generally as pleasing as his connexion with his friends. With his mother, who lived to a great age, he boasted that he had never been reconciled, because he had never quarrelled. He was the only one who could get on with the crusty uncle Caecilius. In the delicate matter of his sister Pomponia's differences with her husband Quintus Cicero, he seems to have acted with kindness as well as prudence; and though he married late in life (B.C. 56, when he was in his fifty-third year), he appears to have made an excellent husband to Pilia and a very affectionate father to his daughter. His unwearied sympathy with the varied moods of Cicero—whether of exultation, irritation, or despair—and the entire confidence which Cicero feels that he will have that sympathy in every case, are creditable to both. It is only between sincere souls that one can speak to the other as to a second self, as Cicero often alleges that he does to Atticus. Of QUINTUS CICERO, the next most important correspondent in this volume, we get a fairly clear picture. Quintus Tullius Cicero. Four years younger than his famous brother (b. B.C. 102), he followed him at the due distance up the ladder of official promotion to the praetorship, to which he was elected in the year of his elder's consulship. There, however, Quintus stopped. He never seems to have stood for the consulship. He had no oratorical genius to give him reputation in the forum, nor were his literary productions of any value, either for style or originality. His abilities for administration, as shown in his three years' government of Asia , appear to have been respectable, but were marred by faults of temper, which too often betrayed him into extreme violence of language. In military command he showed courage and energy in defending his camp in the rising of the Gauls in the winter of B.C. 54—53; but he spoilt the reputation thus gained by the mistake Committed in the autumn of B.C. 53, which Cost the loss of a considerable number of troops, and all but allowed the roving Germans to storm his camp. He remained another year in Gaul , but did nothing to retrieve this mistake. In military affairs fortune rarely forgives. In politics he seems to have contented himself generally with saying ditto to his brother. And this continued to be the case up to Pharsalia. After that, finding himself on the losing side, he turned somewhat fiercely upon the brother, whom he regarded as having misled him; and for a time there was a miserable breach between them, which, however, did not last very long. When the end came it found the brothers united in heart as in misfortune. His private happiness was marred by an uncongenial marriage. Pomponia—sister of Atticus—seems to have been as high-tempered as her husband, and less placable. The constant quarrels between them exercised the patience both of Cicero and Atticus, and crops up all through the correspondence. One effect of them was the loss of all control over their son, who, being called upon to smooth over the differences between father and mother, naturally took up at an early age a line of his own, and showed a disposition to act independently of his elders. The letters to TERENTIA do not fill much space in the Correspondence, and are rarely interesting. Terentia. Married about B.C. 80, Cicero seems to have lived in harmony with her at least till the time of his return from exile, during which unhappy period he acknowledges the activity of her exertions in support of his recall, and the drain which his ruin was making upon her resources. Terentia had a large private fortune, and apparently used it liberally in his service. Nevertheless, immediately on his return from exile, there seems to have been some cause of coldness between the husband and wife. He darkly alludes to certain domestic troubles in the first letter to Atticus written from Rome (vol i., p.189), and repeats the hint in the next (p.193). When he landed at Brundisium it was Tullia, not Terentia, who came to meet him (p.187), and for some time after she appears to be presiding in his house rather than Terentia (see pp.224, 257). Whatever the cause of this coldness was, however, it appears to have been removed for a time. He kept up a correspondence with her while he was in Cilicia (B.C. 51—50), and though he does not seem pleased at her having arranged the marriage of Tullia with Dolabella, he addresses her warmly when about to return, and was met by her on landing. During the five or six months that followed, before Cicero left Italy to join Pompey, there is no indication of any alienation: but the short notes from Pompey's camp, and in the first half of B.C. 47, are cold and conventional, and on his return to Brundisium after Pharsalia, and during his lengthened stay there, he appears to have declined to allow her to come and see him. Soon after his return to Rome , in September, B.C. 47, matters came to a climax. Perhaps some of the mischief was caused by the mismanagement or dishonesty of Terentia's steward, Philotimus, of whom we hear a good deal in the letters from Cilicia : but whatever was the origin of the quarrel, Cicero asserts that on his return he found his affairs in a state of utter disorder. It may well have been that, like other adherents to the losing cause, he had to suffer from loss of any property that could be easily laid hands on in Rome , and that Terentia had had no power to save it. But Cicero, rightly or wrongly, attributed the embarrassment which he found awaiting him to his wife. He says in a letter to Gnaeus Plancius : 20 I should not have taken any new step at a time of such general disaster had not on my return found my private affairs in as sorry a position as the public. The fact is, that when I saw that, owing to the criminal conduct of those to whom my life and fortunes ought, in return for my never-to-be-forgotten services, to have been their dearest object, there was nothing safe within the walls of my house, nothing that was not the subject of some intrigue, I made up my mind that I must arm myself by the faithful support of new marriage connexions against the perfidy of the old. This is a lame excuse for a man of sixty separating from the companion of his whole manhood, and in the eyes of Roman Society it was rendered still more questionable by a prompt marriage with a young girl, rich, and his own ward: from whom, however, he soon again divorced himself, angered, it is said, by her want of feeling at the death of Tullia. Terentia long survived her husband, living, we are told, to be over a hundred years old. Divorce was, of course, not regarded in these days of the Republic as it had once been, or as it is now among ourselves. still we should have been glad, both for his fame and his happiness, if the few years remaining to him had not had this additional cloud. A man of sixty embarking on such matrimonial enterprise is not a dignified spectacle, or one pleasing to gods and men. The other correspondents may be dismissed in few words. P. CORNELIUS LENTULUS SPINTHER, to P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther. whom some of the longest letters are addressed, represents the high aristocracy, to which Cicero wished to commend himself, though seeing keenly the weakness which underlay their magnificence. The part played by Lentulus in politics had been showy, but never founded on steadfast principle. He owed his earlier promotions to Caesar's influence, but in his consulship of B.C. 57 had taken the side of the aristocracy in promoting the recall of Cicero, though he had gone against their sentiment by supporting Pompey's appointment to the cura annonae . But as he was going to Cilicia in B.C. 56, Lentulus wished to have the lucrative task of restoring Ptolemy Auletes to the throne of Egypt , from which he had been righteously driven by his subjects. Therefore it was all to the good that Pompey should have business at home preventing him from taking this in hand. How Lentulus was baulked in this desire will appear in the letters. He no doubt had his full share of the Lenlulitas distinguishing his family. But all was forgiven by Cicero to a man who had promoted his recall, and he takes great pains to justify to Lentulus his own change of policy in regard to the triumvirs after B.C. 56. When the civil war began Lentulus joined Domitius at Corfinium , and with him fell into Caesar's hands, and was dismissed unharmed. He afterwards joined Pompey in Epirus , intent on succeeding Caesar as Pontifex Maximus, as soon as the latter had been satisfactorily disposed of. After Pharsalia he sought refuge at Rhodes , but was refused sanctuary by the islanders, and was eventually put to death, though we do not know by whom ( Att. 11.13 ; Fam. 9.18 ). M. FADIUS GALLUS, the Epicurean, and M. MARIUS, the valetudinarian and wit, were among friends valued for their personal and agreeable qualities M. Fadius Gallus M. Marius L. Lucceius C. Scribonius Curio C. Trebatius Testa. rather than for any public or political importance attaching to them. The same may be said of L. LUCCEIUS, of whose Roman history Cicero thought so well, that he wrote a remarkable letter begging for an honourable place in it for his consulship, as Pliny did to Tacitus. 21 C. SCRIBONIUS CURIO, son of a great friend of Cicero, after a jeunesse orageuse, returned to Rome from his quaestorship in Asia , in B.C. 53, to take up the inheritance of his father, which he quickly dissipated. Cicero seems to have had a high idea of his abilities, and to have believed him capable of taking the lead of the Optimates. But in his tribuneship of B.C. 51—50 he disappointed all such hopes by openly joining Caesar's party, and resisting all attempts to recall him. He joined Caesar at Ravenna as soon as his tribuneship was out, and urged him to march on Rome . In B.C. 49 he was sent to secure Sicily and Africa . The first he did, but in the second he perished in battle against the senatorial governor and king Iuba. Cicero's relation to C. TREBATIUS TESTA, a learned jurisconsult, was apparently that of a patron or tutor, who, thinking that he has found a young man of ability, endeavours to push him. He sent him with a letter of introduction to Caesar, who was good-natured, though rather sarcastic as to the scope for legal abilities to be found in Gaul . He gave him, however, a military tribuneship, without exacting military duties, and apparently kept on good terms with him, for he employed him in B.C. 49 to communicate his wish to Cicero as to his remaining at Rome . Cicero 's letters to him, though numerous, are not among the most interesting. They are full of banter of a rather forced and dull kind; and Cicero was evidently annoyed to find that his scheme for advancing Trebatius in Caesar's province had not been very successful. The friendship, however, survived the civil war, and we find Cicero in B.C. 44 dedicating his Topica to Trebatius. “ “Tullius, of all the sons of royal Rome That are, or have been, or are yet to come, Most skilled to plead, most learned in debate,— Catullus hails thee, small as thou art great. Take thou from him his thanks, his fond regards, The first of patrons from the least of bards.” ” Catullus, xlix. (J. E. S.)","Note: 1 That Cicero up to the time                                                   of his consulship had been connected rather with                                                   the populares is illustrated by Quintus ( de Petit 1) urging him to make                                                   it clear that he had never been a demagogue, but                                                   that if he had ever spoken  in the spirit of the                                                   popular party, he had done so with the view of                                                   attracting Pompey.,Note: 2 The city, the                                                   city, my dear Rufus—stick to that, and                                                   live in its full light.

                                                  63). It begins in B.C. 68, and between that date
                                                  and B.C. 65 there are
                                                  only eleven letters. We have, therefore, nothing
                                                  exactly contemporaneous to help us to form a
                                                  judgment on the great event which coloured so much
                                                  of his after life, the suppression of the
                                                  Catilinarian conspiracy and the execution of the
                                                  conspirators, in the last month of his consulship.
                                                  But setting aside the first eleven letters, we
                                                  have from that time forward a correspondence
                                                  illustrating, as no other document in antiquity
                                                  does, the hopes and fears, the doubts and
                                                  difficulties, of a keen politician living through
                                                  the most momentous period of Roman history, the
                                                  period of the fall of the Republic, beginning with
                                                  Pompey's return from the East in B.C. 62, and ending with the appearance of
                                                  the young Octavian on the scene and the formation
                                                  of the Triumvirate in B.C.
                                                  43, of whose victims Cicero was one of the
                                                  first and most illustrious. It is by his conduct
                                                  and speeches during this period that Cicero's
                                                  claim to be a statesman and a patriot must be
                                                  judged, and by his writings in the same period
                                                  that his place in literature must chiefly be
                                                  assigned. Before B.C. 63
                                                  his biography, if we had it, would be that of the
                                                  advocate and the official, no doubt with certain
                                                  general views on political questions as they
                                                  occurred, but not yet committed definitely to a
                                                  party, or inclined to regard politics as the
                                                  absorbing interest of his life. In his early youth
                                                  his hero had been his fellow townsman Marius, in
                                                  whose honour he composed a poem about the time of
                                                  taking the,toga,,virilis,. But it was as the successful
                                                  general, and before the days of the civil war. And
                                                  though he served in the army of Sulla in the
                                                  Marsic war (B.C.
                                                  90—88), he
                                                  always regarded his cruelties with horror, however
                                                  much he may have afterwards approved of certain
                                                  points of his legislation. It was not till the
                                                  consulship that he became definitely a party man,insert_note_19,1,and an Optimate, and
                                                  even then his feelings were much distracted by a
                                                  strong belief—strangely
                                                  ill-founded—that Pompey would be as
                                                  successful as a statesman as he had been fortunate
                                                  as a general. For him he had also a warm personal
                                                  attachment, which never seems to have wholly died
                                                  out, in spite of much petulance of language. This
                                                  partly accounts for the surrender of B.C. 56, and his acquiescence
                                                  in the policy of the triumvirs, an acquiescence
                                                  never hearty indeed, as far as Caesar and Crassus
                                                  were concerned, but in which he consoled himself
                                                  with the belief that nothing very unconstitutional
                                                  could be done while Pompey was practically
                                                  directing affairs at,Rome,.,,,The various nature of the
                                                  Correspondence.,It is through this period of political change
                                                  and excitement that the correspondence will take
                                                  us, with some important gaps indeed, but on the
                                                  whole fullest when it is most wanted to show the
                                                  feelings and motives guiding the active
                                                  politicians of the day, or at any rate the effect
                                                  which events had upon one eager and acute
                                                  intellect and sensitive heart. One charm of the
                                                  correspondence is variety. There is almost every
                                                  sort of letter. Those to Atticus are unstudied,
                                                  spontaneous, and reflect the varying moods of the
                                                  writer. At times of special excitement they follow
                                                  each other day by day, and sometimes more than
                                                  once in the same day; and the writer seems to
                                                  conceal nothing, however much it might expose him
                                                  to ridicule, and to the charge of fickleness,
                                                  weakness, or even cowardice. Those addressed to
                                                  other friends are sometimes familiar and playful,
                                                  some times angry and indignant. Some of them are
                                                  careful and elaborate state papers, others mere
                                                  formal introductions and recommendations.
                                                  Business, literature, and philosophy all have
                                                  their share in them; and, what is so rare in
                                                  ancient literature, the family relations of the
                                                  writer, his dealings with wife, son, and daughter,
                                                  brother and nephew, and sons-in-law, are all
                                                  depicted for us, often with the utmost frankness.
                                                  After reading them we seem to know Cicero the man,
                                                  as well as Cicero the statesman and orator. The
                                                  eleven letters which precede the consulship are
                                                  happily, from this point of view, addressed to
                                                  Atticus. For it was to Atticus that he wrote with
                                                  the least concealment, and with the confidence
                                                  that any detail, however small, which concerned
                                                  himself would be interesting to his correspondent.
                                                  It is well, therefore, that, though we thus come
                                                  into his life when it was more than half over, we
                                                  should at once hear his genuine sentiments on
                                                  whatever subjects he may be speaking. Besides his
                                                  own, we have about ninety letters to Cicero from
                                                  some of the chief men of the day—Pompey,
                                                  Caesar, Cato, Brutus, Antony, and many others.
                                                  They are of very various excellence. The best of
                                                  them are by much less known men. Neither Pompey
                                                  nor Caesar were good letter-writers, or, if the
                                                  latter was so, he was too busy to use his
                                                  powers.,,,Cicero's position previous to the beginning

                                                  thirty-seventh year. He was already a man of
                                                  established reputation both as a pleader and a
                                                  writer. Rhetorical treatises (B.C. 86), translations from Xenophon and
                                                  Plato (B.C. 84), and from
                                                  the poems of Aratus (B.C.
                                                  81), had given evidence of a varied
                                                  literary interest and a promise of future
                                                  eminence, while his success as an advocate had led
                                                  to the first step in the official,cursus,,honorum,by his becoming

                                                  quaestor in,Sicily,were not such as to bring a
                                                  man's name much before the Roman public, Cicero
                                                  plumes himself, as was not unusual with him, on

                                                  administration. He has indeed the honesty to tell
                                                  against himself the story of the acquaintance who,
                                                  meeting him at,Puteoli,on his return journey, asked

                                                  the news there. When he answered rather crossly

                                                  done sufficiently well in,Lilybaeum,to give
                                                  him his next step, the aedileship to which he was
                                                  elected B.C. 70, and to
                                                  induce the Sicilians to apply to him, when in that
                                                  year they desired the prosecution of the
                                                  extortionate Verres. His energy and success in
                                                  this business raised him, without question, to the
                                                  first rank of advocates, and pledged him to a
                                                  righteous policy in regard to the government of
                                                  the provinces.,,,Cicero's Boyhood and Education,Still Cicero was a,novus,,homo,, and the jealous exclusiveness of
                                                  the great families at,Rome,might yet
                                                  prevent his attainment of the highest office of
                                                  all. When the correspondence opens he is a
                                                  candidate for the praetorship, which he obtained
                                                  without difficulty, at the head of the poll. But
                                                  his birth might still be a bar to the consulship.
                                                  His father, M. Tullius, lived at,Arpinum,, an
                                                  ancient city of the Volscians and afterwards of
                                                  the Samnites, which had long enjoyed a partial,
                                                  and from B.C. 188 a
                                                  complete, Roman franchise, and was included in the
                                                  Cornelian tribe. Cicero's mother's name was
                                                  Helvia, of whom we know nothing but the one
                                                  anecdote told by Quintus (,Fam.
                                                  16.26,), who says that she used to seal the
                                                  wine jars when they were emptied, so that none
                                                  might be drained without her knowing
                                                  it—a testimony to her economy and
                                                  careful housewifery. His father had weak health
                                                  and resided almost entirely in his villa at,Arpinum,, which he had considerably
                                                  enlarged, much devoted to study and literature
                                                  (,de Leg. 2.1,). But though he
                                                  apparently possessed considerable property, giving
                                                  him equestrian rank, and though Cicero says that
                                                  his family was very ancient, yet neither he nor
                                                  any of his ancestors had held Roman magistracies.
                                                  Marcus and his brother Quintus were the first of
                                                  their family to do so, and both had to depend on
                                                  character and ability to secure their elections.
                                                  But though the father did nothing for his sons by
                                                  holding curule office himself, he did the best for
                                                  their education that was possible. Cicero calls
                                                  him,optimus,,et,,prudentissimus,, and speaks with
                                                  gratitude of what he had done for his sons in this
                                                  respect. They were sent early to,Rome,to the house
                                                  of C. Aculeo, a learned jurisconsult, married to a
                                                  sister of Helvia; and attended—with
                                                  their cousins, the sons of Aculeo—the
                                                  best schools in the city (,De Orat.
                                                  2.1-2,). The young Marcus showed
                                                  extraordinary ability from the first, and that
                                                  avidity for reading and study which never forsook
                                                  him. As a young man he diligently attended the
                                                  chambers of renowned jurisconsults, especially
                                                  those of the elder and younger Scaevola, Crassus,
                                                  and Antonius, and soon found that his calling in
                                                  life was oratory. It was not till he was
                                                  twenty-eight years old, however—when he
                                                  had already written much and pleaded many
                                                  cases—that he went on a visit of between
                                                  two and three years to,Greece,,,Asia,, and,Rhodes,, to study in
                                                  the various schools of rhetoric and philosophy,
                                                  and to view their famous cities (B.C. 79—77).
                                                  It was after his return from this tour that his
                                                  age (he was now thirty-one) made the seeking of
                                                  office at,Rome,possible From that time his
                                                  election to the several
                                                  offices—quaestorship, aedileship,
                                                  praetorship, consulship—followed without
                                                  any repulse, each in the first year of his age at
                                                  which he was legally capable of being elected.,He had doubtless made the acquaintance of Titus
                                                  Pomponius, afterwards called Atticus, early in
                                                  life. But it seems that it was their intimacy at,Athens,(B.C. 79), where Atticus,
                                                  who was three years his senior, had been residing
                                                  for several years, that began the very close and
                                                  warm friendship which lasted with nothing but the
                                                  slightest and most passing of clouds till his
                                                  death. His brother Quintus was married to
                                                  Pomponia, a sister of Atticus; but the marriage
                                                  turned out unfortunately, and was a strain upon
                                                  the friendship of Cicero and Atticus rather than
                                                  an additional bond. This source of uneasiness
                                                  meets us in the very first letter of the
                                                  correspondence, and crops up again and again till
                                                  the final rupture of the ill-assorted union by
                                                  divorce in B.C. 44.
                                                  Nothing, however, had apparently interrupted the
                                                  correspondence of the two friends, which had been
                                                  going on for a long time before the first letter

                                                  success as an advocate and rising official, not as
                                                  yet apparently much interested in party politics,
                                                  but with his mind, in the intervals of forensic
                                                  business, engaged on the adornment of the new
                                                  villa at,Tusculum,, the first of the numerous
                                                  country residences which his growing wealth or his
                                                  heightened ideas of the dignity of his position
                                                  prompted him to purchase. Atticus is commissioned
                                                  to search in,Athens,and elsewhere for objects of
                                                  art suitable for the residence of a wealthy Roman,
                                                  who at the same time was a scholar and man of
                                                  letters. He is beginning to feel the charm of at
                                                  any rate a temporary retreat from the constant
                                                  bustle and occupations of the city. Though Cicero
                                                  loved,Rome,, and could hardly conceive of
                                                  life unconnected with its business and
                                                  excitements,,insert_note_175,2,and eagerly looked for news of the
                                                  city in his absence, yet there was another side to
                                                  his character. His interest in literature and
                                                  philosophy was quite as genuine as his interest in
                                                  the forum and senate-house. When the season came
                                                  for temporarily withdrawing from the latter, he
                                                  returned to the former with eager passion. But,Tusculum,was too near,Rome,to secure him
                                                  the quiet and solitude necessary for study and
                                                  composition. Thus, though he says (vol. i., p.4),
                                                  ""I am so delighted with my Tusculan villa that I

                                                  the future. The few letters of B.C. 68—67
                                                  are full of directions to Atticus for the

                                                  exercised the minds of admirers, who do not like
                                                  to think Cicero capable of such a cold-hearted
                                                  sentence. It is certainly very unlike his usual
                                                  manner.,insert_note_239,4,He is more apt to
                                                  exaggerate than understate his emotions; and in
                                                  the first letter extant he speaks with real
                                                  feeling of the death of a cousin.
                                                  Elsewhere—as we have seen—he
                                                  refers to his father with respect and gratitude.
                                                  How then are we to account for such a cold
                                                  announcement? Several expedients have been hit
                                                  upon. First, to change,decessit,to,discessit,, and to refer the sentence to
                                                  the father's quitting,Rome,, and not life;
                                                  in which case it is not easy to see why the
                                                  information is given at all. Second, to suppose it
                                                  to be a mere answer to a request for the
                                                  information on the part of Atticus; in which case
                                                  the date must refer to some previous year, or the
                                                  letter must be placed considerably later, to allow
                                                  of time for Atticus to hear of the death and to
                                                  write his question. In favour of the first is the
                                                  fact that Asconius (§ 82) says that
                                                  Cicero lost his father when he was a candidate for
                                                  the consulship (B.C. 64).
                                                  Some doubt has been thrown upon the genuineness of
                                                  the passage in Asconius; and, if that is not
                                                  trustworthy, we have nothing else to help us. On
                                                  the whole I think we must leave the announcement
                                                  as it stands in all its baldness. Cicero's father
                                                  had long been an invalid, and Atticus may have
                                                  been well aware that the end was expected. He
                                                  would also be acquainted with the son's feelings
                                                  towards his father, and Cicero may have held it
                                                  unnecessary to enlarge upon them. It is possible,
                                                  too, that he had already written to tell Atticus
                                                  of the death and of his own feelings, but had
                                                  omitted the date, which he here supplies. Whatever
                                                  may be the true explanation—impossible
                                                  now to recover—everything we know of
                                                  Cicero forbids us to reckon insensibility among
                                                  his faults, or reserve in expressing his feelings
                                                  among his characteristics.,,,The Praetorship, B.C.
                                                  66,In the next year (B.C.
                                                  67) we find Cicero elected to the
                                                  praetorship, after at least two interruptions to
                                                  the,comitia,, which,
                                                  though not aimed at himself, gave him a foretaste
                                                  of the political troubles to come a few years
                                                  later. He is, however, at present simply annoyed
                                                  at the inconvenience, not yet apprehensive of any
                                                  harm to the constitution. The double postponement,
                                                  indeed, had the effect of gratifying his vanity:
                                                  for his own name was returned three times first of
                                                  the list of eight. His praetorship (B.C. 66) passed without any
                                                  startling event. The two somewhat meagre letters
                                                  which remain belonging to this year tell us hardly
                                                  anything. Still he began more or less to define
                                                  his political position by advocating the,lex,,Manilia,, for putting the
                                                  Mithridatic war into the hands of Pompey; and one
                                                  of his most elaborate forensic speeches
                                                  —that for Cluentius—was
                                                  delivered in the course of the year: in which also
                                                  his brother Quintus was elected to the
                                                  aedileship.,,,Preparations for the Consulship, B.C. 65—64,So far Cicero had risen steadily and without
                                                  serious difficulty up the official ladder. But the
                                                  stress was now to come. The old families seem not
                                                  to have been so ready to oppose the rise of the,novus,,homo,to the
                                                  praetorship. It was the consulship on which they
                                                  tried to keep a tight hand. Accordingly,
                                                  immediately after the year of his praetorship, we
                                                  find him anxiously looking out for support and
                                                  inquiring who are likely to be his competitors.
                                                  The interesting point in regard to this is his
                                                  connexion with Catiline. In his speech in the
                                                  senate delivered in the following year (,in,,toga,,candida,, B.C. 64) he denounced Catiline
                                                  in the most violent language, accusing him of
                                                  every conceivable crime; yet in B.C. 65 he not only contemplated being
                                                  elected with him without any expression of
                                                  disgust, but even considered whether he should not
                                                  undertake his defence on some charge that was
                                                  being brought against him—perhaps for
                                                  his conduct during the Sullan proscriptions. To
                                                  whitewash Catiline is a hopeless task; and it
                                                  throws a lurid light upon the political and moral
                                                  sentiments of the time to find Cicero even
                                                  contemplating such a conjunction.,After this, for two years, there is a break in
                                                  the correspondence. Atticus had probably returned
                                                  to,Rome,,
                                                  and if there were letters to others (as no doubt
                                                  there were) they have been lost. A certain light
                                                  is thrown on the proceedings of the year of
                                                  candidature (B.C. 64) by
                                                  the essay ""On the duties of a candidate,"" ascribed
                                                  to his brother Quintus, who was himself to be a
                                                  candidate for the praetorship in the next year
                                                  (B.C. 63). We may see
                                                  from this essay that Pompey was still regarded as
                                                  the greatest and most influential man at,Rome,;
                                                  that Catiline's character was so atrocious in the
                                                  eyes of most, that his opposition was not to be
                                                  feared; that Cicero's ""newness "" was a really
                                                  formidable bar to his election, and that his chief
                                                  support was to be looked for from the individuals
                                                  and companies for whom he had acted as counsel,
                                                  and who hoped to secure his services in the
                                                  future. The support of the nobles was not a
                                                  certainty. There had been a taint of popularity in
                                                  some of Cicero's utterances, and the writer urges
                                                  him to convince the consulars that he was at one
                                                  with the Optimates, while at the same time aiming
                                                  at the conciliation of the equestrian order. This
                                                  was, in fact, to be Cicero's political position in
                                                  the future. The party of the
                                                  Optimates—in spite of his disgust at the
                                                  indifference and frivolity of many of
                                                  them—was to be his party: his favourite
                                                  constitutional object was to be to keep the
                                                  equites and the senate on good terms: and his
                                                  greatest embarrassment was how to reconcile this
                                                  position with his personal loyalty to Pompey, and
                                                  his views as to the reforms necessary in the
                                                  government of the provinces.,,,The Consulship, B.C.
                                                  63.,For the momentous year of the consulship we
                                                  have no letters. His brother Quintus was in,Rome,as
                                                  candidate and then praetor-designate; Atticus was
                                                  also in,Rome,; and the business, as well as

                                                  like ordinary correspondence. Of the earlier part
                                                  of the consulship we have little record. The
                                                  speeches against Rullus were delivered at the
                                                  beginning of the year, and commit Cicero pretty
                                                  definitely to a policy as to the,ager,,publicus,—which
                                                  was, to his disgust, entirely reversed by the
                                                  triumvirs in B.C.
                                                  59—but they do not show any sense
                                                  of coming trouble. Cicero, however, throughout his
                                                  consulship took a very definite line against the,populares,. Not only
                                                  did he defend Rabirius Postumus, when accused by
                                                  Caesar of the assassination of Saturninus, and

                                                  resisted the restoration to their civil rights of
                                                  the sons of the men proscribed by Sulla, avowedly
                                                  on the ground of the necessity of maintaining the
                                                  established order, though he knew and confessed
                                                  the justice of the proposal.,insert_note_340,5,,,The Conspiracy of Catiline.,Any movement, therefore, on the side of the
                                                  popular party had now his opposition with which to
                                                  reckon. He professes to have known very early in
                                                  his year of office that some more than usually
                                                  dangerous movement was in contemplation. We cannot
                                                  well decide from the violent denunciation of
                                                  Catiline contained—to judge from extant
                                                  fragments—in the speech,in,,toga,,candida,, how far
                                                  Cicero was really acquainted with any definite
                                                  designs of his. Roman orators indulged in a
                                                  violence of language so alien from modern ideas
                                                  and habits, that it is difficult to draw definite
                                                  conclusions. But it appears from Sallust that
                                                  Catiline had, in a secret meeting before the
                                                  elections of B.C. 64,
                                                  professed an intention of going all lengths in a
                                                  revolutionary programme and, if that was the case,
                                                  Cicero would be sure to have had some secret
                                                  information on the subject. But his hands were
                                                  partly tied by the fact that the,comitia,had given him a
                                                  colleague-C. Antonius- deeply implicated in
                                                  Catiline's policy, whatever it was. Pompey, whom
                                                  he regarded as the champion of law and order, was
                                                  in the East: and Catiline's
                                                  candidature—and it was supposed his
                                                  policy also—had had the almost open
                                                  support of the richest man in,Rome,, M. Licinius
                                                  Crassus, and of the most influential man of the,populares,, C. Iulius
                                                  Caesar. In the house of one or the other of them,
                                                  indeed, the meeting at which Catiline first
                                                  unfolded his purposes was believed to have been
                                                  held. Still Catiline had not been guilty of any
                                                  overt act which enabled Cicero to attack him. He
                                                  had, indeed, been informed, on very questionable
                                                  authority, that Catiline had made a plot to
                                                  assassinate him while holding the elections, and
                                                  he made a considerable parade of taking
                                                  precautions for his safety—letting it be
                                                  seen that he wore a cuirass under his toga, and
                                                  causing his house to be guarded by the younger
                                                  members of his party. The elections, according to
                                                  Plutarch, had at least been once postponed from
                                                  the ordinary time in July, though this has been
                                                  denied.,insert_note_372,6,At any
                                                  rate it was not till they had taken place and
                                                  Catiline had been once more rejected, that any
                                                  definite step is alleged to have been taken by
                                                  him, such as Cicero could lay hold of to attack
                                                  him. On the 20th of October, in the senate, Cicero
                                                  made a speech warning the Fathers of the impending
                                                  danger, and on the 21st called upon Catiline for
                                                  an explanation in their presence. But, after all,
                                                  even the famous meeting of the 5th of November, in
                                                  the house of M. Porcius Laeca, betrayed to Cicero
                                                  by Fulvia, the mistress of Q. Curius, would not
                                                  have sufficed as grounds for the denunciation of
                                                  the first extant speech against Catiline (7th of
                                                  November), if it had not been for something else.
                                                  For some months past there had been rumours of
                                                  risings in various parts of,Italy,; but by the
                                                  beginning of November it was known that C. Manlius
                                                  (or Mallius) had collected a band of desperadoes
                                                  near,Faesulae,, and, having established
                                                  there a camp on the 27th of October, meant to
                                                  advance on,Rome,. Manlius had been a centurion in
                                                  Sulla's army, and had received an allotment of
                                                  confiscated land in Etruria; but, like others, had
                                                  failed to prosper. The movement was one born of
                                                  discontent with embarrassments which were mostly
                                                  brought about by extravagance or incompetence. But
                                                  the rapidity with which Manlius was able to gather
                                                  a formidable force round him seems to show that
                                                  there were genuine grievances also affecting the
                                                  agricultural classes in Etruria generally. At any
                                                  rate there was now no doubt that a formidable
                                                  disturbance was brewing; the senate voted that
                                                  there was a,tumultus,,
                                                  authorized the raising of troops, and named
                                                  commanders in the several districts affected. It
                                                  was complicity in this rising that Cicero now
                                                  sought to establish against Catiline and his
                                                  partisans in,Rome,. The report of the meeting in
                                                  the house of Laeca gave him the pretext for his
                                                  first step—a fiery denunciation of
                                                  Catiline in the senate on the 7th of November.
                                                  Catiline left,Rome,, joined the camp of Manlius, and
                                                  assumed the ensigns of,imperium,. That he was allowed thus to
                                                  leave the city is a proof that Cicero had as yet
                                                  no information enabling him to act at once. It was
                                                  the right of every citizen to avoid standing a
                                                  trial by going into exile. Catiline was now under
                                                  notice of prosecution for,vis,, and when leaving,Rome,he professed
                                                  to be going to,Marseilles,, which had the,jus,,exilii,. But when it was
                                                  known that he had stopped short at,Faesulae,the
                                                  senate at once declared both him and Manlius,hostes,, and
                                                  authorized the consuls to proceed against them.
                                                  The expedition was intrusted to Antonius, in spite
                                                  of his known sympathy with Catiline, while Cicero
                                                  was retained with special powers to protect the
                                                  city. The result is too well known to be more than
                                                  glanced at here. Catiline's partisans were
                                                  detected by letters confided to certain envoys of
                                                  the Allobroges, which were held to convict them of
                                                  the guilt of treason, as instigating Catiline to
                                                  march on,Rome,, and the senate of the
                                                  Allobroges to assist the invasion by sending
                                                  Cavalry to,Faesulae,.,,,Execution of he conspirators, December,
                                                  B.C. 63. Its legal
                                                  grounds and consequences.,The decree of the senate,,videant,,consules,,,etc,.,, had come to be
                                                  considered as reviving the full,imperium,of the consul, and investing
                                                  him with the power of life and death over all
                                                  citizens. Cicero acted on this (questionable)
                                                  constitutional doctrine. He endeavoured, indeed,
                                                  to shelter himself under the authority of a
                                                  senatorial vote. But the senate never had the
                                                  power to try or condemn a citizen. It could only
                                                  record its advice to the consul. The whole legal
                                                  responsibility for the condemnation and death of
                                                  the conspirators, arrested in consequence of these
                                                  letters, rested on the consul. To our moral
                                                  judgment as to Cicero's conduct it is of primary
                                                  importance to determine whether or not these men
                                                  were guilty: to his legal and constitutional
                                                  position it matters not at all. Nor was that point
                                                  ever raised against him. The whole question turns
                                                  on whether the doctrine was true that the,senatus,,consultum,,ultimum,gave
                                                  the consul the right of inflicting death upon
                                                  citizens without trial, i.e., without appeal to
                                                  the people, on the analogy of the,dictator,,seditionis,,sedandae,,causa,, thus practically defeating that
                                                  most ancient and cherished safeguard of Roman
                                                  liberty, the,ius,,provocationis,. The precedents were few,
                                                  and scarcely such as would appeal to popular
                                                  approval. The murder of Tiberius Gracchus had been,ex,,post,,facto,approved by the senate in B.C. 133—2. In the
                                                  case of Gaius Gracchus, in B.C.
                                                  121, the senate had voted,uti,,consul,,Opimius,,rempublicam,,defenderet,, and in virtue of that the
                                                  consul had authorized the killing of Gaius and his
                                                  friends: thus for the first time exercising,imperium,,sine,,provocatione,. Opimius had been impeached
                                                  after his year of office, but acquitted, which the
                                                  senate might claim as a confirmation of the right,
                                                  in spite of the,lex,of Gaius Gracchus, which confirmed the right of,provocatio,in all
                                                  cases. In B.C. 100 the
                                                  tribune Saturninus and the praetor Glaucia were
                                                  arrested in consequence of a similar decree, which
                                                  this time joined the other magistrates to the
                                                  consuls as authorized to protect the Republic:
                                                  their death, however, was an act of violence on
                                                  the part of a mob. Its legality had been impugned
                                                  by Caesar's condemnation of Rabirius, as,duovir,,capitalis,, but to a
                                                  certain extent confirmed by the failure to secure
                                                  his conviction on the trial of his appeal to the
                                                  people. In B.C. 88 and
                                                  83 this decree of the
                                                  senate was again passed, in the first case in
                                                  favour of Sulla against the tribune Sulpicius, who
                                                  was in consequence put to death; and in the second
                                                  case in favour of the consuls (partisans of
                                                  Marius) against the followers of Sulla. Again in
                                                  B.C. 77 the decree was
                                                  passed in consequence of the insurrection of the
                                                  proconsul Lepidus, who, however, escaped to,Sardinia,and died there.,In every case but one this decree had been
                                                  passed against the popular party. The only legal
                                                  sanction given to the exercise of the,imperium,,sine,,provocatione,was
                                                  the acquittal of the consul Opimius in B.C. 120. But the jury which
                                                  tried that case probably consisted entirely of
                                                  senators, who would not stultify their own
                                                  proceedings by condemning him. To rely upon such
                                                  precedents required either great boldness (never a
                                                  characteristic of,Cicero,), or the most profound
                                                  conviction of the essential righteousness of the
                                                  measure, and the clearest assurance that the
                                                  safety of the state—the supreme
                                                  law—justified the breach of every
                                                  constitutional principle.,Cicero,was not left
                                                  long in doubt as to whether there would be any to
                                                  question his proceeding. On the last day of the
                                                  year, when about to address the people, as was
                                                  customary, on laying down his consulship, the
                                                  tribune Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos forbade him to
                                                  speak, on the express ground that he ""had put
                                                  citizens to death uncondemned ""—,quod,,cives,,indemnatos,,necavisset,. Cicero consoled himself with
                                                  taking the required oath as to having observed the
                                                  laws, with an additional declaration that he had
                                                  ""saved the state."" Nevertheless, he must have felt
                                                  deeply annoyed and alarmed at the action of
                                                  Metellus, for he had been a,legatus,of Pompey, and was supposed to
                                                  represent his views, and it was upon the
                                                  approbation and support of Pompey, now on the eve
                                                  of his return from the East, that Cicero
                                                  particularly reckoned.,,,Letters after B. C. 63.,The letters in our collection now recommence.
                                                  The first of the year (B.C.
                                                  62) is one addressed to Pompey, expressing
                                                  some discontent at the qualified manner in which
                                                  he had written on recent events, and affirming his
                                                  own conviction that he had acted in the best
                                                  interests of the state and with universal
                                                  approval. But indeed the whole correspondence to
                                                  the end of Cicero's exile is permeated with this
                                                  subject directly or indirectly. His quarrel with
                                                  Metellus Nepos brought upon him a remonstrance
                                                  from the latter's brother (or cousin), Metellus
                                                  Celer (Letters XIII, XIV), and when the
                                                  correspondence for B.C.
                                                  61 opens, we find him already on the eve of
                                                  the quarrel with Publius Clodius which was to
                                                  bring upon him the exile of B.C.
                                                  58.,,,Publius Clodius Pulcher.,P. CLODIUS PULCHER was an extreme instance of a
                                                  character not uncommon among the nobility in the
                                                  last age of the Republic. Of high birth, and
                                                  possessed of no small amount of ability and
                                                  energy, he belonged by origin and connexion to the
                                                  Optimates; but he regarded politics as a game to
                                                  be played for his personal aggrandizement, and
                                                  public office as a means of replenishing a purse
                                                  drained by boundless extravagance and
                                                  self-indulgence. His record had been bad. He had
                                                  accompanied his brother-in-law Lucullus, or had
                                                  joined his staff, in the war with Mithridates, and
                                                  had helped to excite a mutiny in his army in
                                                  revenge for some fancied slight. He had then gone
                                                  to,Cilicia,, where another
                                                  brother-in-law, Q. Marcus Rex, was propraetor, and
                                                  while commanding a fleet under him had fallen into
                                                  the hands of pirates, and when freed from them had
                                                  gone—apparently in a private
                                                  capacity—to,Antioch,, where he again excited a
                                                  mutiny of Syrian troops engaged in a war against
                                                  the Arabians (B.C.
                                                  70—65). On his
                                                  return to,Rome,he attempted to make himself
                                                  conspicuous by prosecuting Catiline, but accepted
                                                  a bribe to withdraw. In B.C.
                                                  64, on the staff of the governor of,Gallia
                                                  Narbonensis,, he is accused of having
                                                  enriched himself with plunder. For a time after

                                                  of the Optimates; seems to have supported Cicero
                                                  during the Catiline conspiracy; and in B.C. 62 stood for the
                                                  quaestorship and was elected. His violation of the
                                                  mysteries was alleged to have been committed in
                                                  December of that year, and before he could go to
                                                  the province allotted to him as quaestor in,Sicily,he
                                                  had to stand a trial for sacrilege. Such an
                                                  offence—penetrating in disguise into the
                                                  house of the Pontifex Maximus, when his wife was
                                                  engaged in the secret rites of the Bona
                                                  Dea—would place him under a curse, and
                                                  not only prevent his entering upon his
                                                  quaestorship, but would disfranchise and
                                                  politically ruin him. Clodius would seem not to
                                                  have been a person of sufficient character or
                                                  importance to make this trial a political event.
                                                  But not only had he powerful backers, but his
                                                  opponents also, by proposing an innovation in the
                                                  manner of selecting the jurors for trying him, had
                                                  managed to give a spurious political importance to
                                                  the case. One of the most brilliant of the early
                                                  letters (XV, p.37) gives us a graphic picture of
                                                  the trial. Clodius was acquitted and went to his
                                                  province, but returned in B.C.
                                                  60, apparently prepared for a change of
                                                  parties. Cicero and he had quarreled over the
                                                  trial. He had said sarcastic things about the
                                                  sacred consulship, and Cicero had retaliated by
                                                  bitter speeches in the senate, and by giving
                                                  evidence at the trial of having seen Clodius in,Rome,three hours before he professed to have been at,Interamna,, on the day of the alleged
                                                  sacrilege. It is perhaps possible that his alibi
                                                  may have been true in substance, for he may have
                                                  been well out of,Rome,on his way to,Interamna,after
                                                  seeing Cicero. But, however that may be, he
                                                  nourished a grudge against Cicero, which he
                                                  presently had an opportunity of satisfying. The
                                                  year of his return to,Rome,from,Sicily,(B.C. 60) was the same as
                                                  that of Caesar's return from,Spain,.
                                                  Pompey—who had returned the year
                                                  before—was at enmity with the senate on
                                                  account of the difficulties raised to the
                                                  confirmation of his,acta,and the allotments for his
                                                  veterans. Caesar had a grievance because of the
                                                  difficulties put in the way of his triumph. The
                                                  two coalesced, taking in the millionaire Crassus,
                                                  to form a triumvirate or coalition of three, with
                                                  a view to getting measures they desired passed,
                                                  and offices for themselves or their partisans.
                                                  This was a great blow to Cicero, who clung
                                                  feverously to Pompey as a political leader, but
                                                  could not follow him in a coalition with Caesar:
                                                  for he knew that the object of it was a series of
                                                  measures of which he heartily disapproved. His
                                                  hope of seeing Pompey coming to act as
                                                  acknowledged leader of the Optimates was dashed to
                                                  the ground. He could not make up his mind wholly
                                                  to abandon him, or, on the other hand, to cut
                                                  himself adrift from the party of Optimates, to
                                                  whose policy he had so deeply committed himself.
                                                  Clodius was troubled by no such scruples. Perhaps
                                                  Caesar had given him substantial reasons for his
                                                  change of policy. At any rate, from this time
                                                  forward he acts as an extreme,popularis,—much too extreme,
                                                  as it turned out, for Pompey's taste. As a
                                                  patrician his next step in the official ladder
                                                  would naturally have been the aedileship. But that
                                                  peaceful office did not suit his present purpose.
                                                  The tribuneship would give him the right to bring
                                                  forward measures in the,comitia,,tributa,, such as he desired to pass, and
                                                  would in particular give him the opportunity of
                                                  attacking Cicero. The difficulty was that to
                                                  become tribune he must cease to be a patrician. He
                                                  could only do that by being adopted into a
                                                  plebeian gens. He had a plebeian ready to do it in
                                                  B.C. 59. But for a man
                                                  who was,sui,,iuris,to
                                                  be adopted required a formal meeting of the old,comitia,,curiata,, and
                                                  such a meeting required the presence of an augur,
                                                  as well as some kind of sanction of the
                                                  pontifices. Caesar was Pontifex Maximus, and
                                                  Pompey was a member of the college of augurs.
                                                  Their influence would be sufficient to secure or
                                                  prevent this being done. Their consent was, it
                                                  appears, for a time withheld. But Caesar was going
                                                  to,Gaul,at the end of his consulship, and desired to have
                                                  as few powerful enemies at,Rome,during his
                                                  absence as possible. Still he had a personal
                                                  feeling for Cicero, and when it was known that one
                                                  of Clodius's objects in seeking to become a
                                                  plebeian and a tribune was to attack him, Caesar
                                                  offered him two chances of honourable
                                                  retreat—first as one of the
                                                  commissioners to administer his land law, and
                                                  again as one of his,legati,in,Gaul,. But Cicero would not accept the
                                                  first, because he was vehemently opposed to the
                                                  law itself: nor the second, because he had no
                                                  taste for provincial business, even supposing the
                                                  proconsul to be to his liking; and because he
                                                  could not believe that P. Clodius would venture to
                                                  attack him, or would succeed if he did. Caesar's
                                                  consulship of B.C. 59
                                                  roused his worst fears for the Republic; and,
                                                  though he thought little of the statesmanship or
                                                  good sense of Caesar's hostile colleague Bibulus,
                                                  he was thoroughly disgusted with the policy of the
                                                  triumvirs, with the contemptuous treatment of the
                                                  senate, with the highhanded disregard of the
                                                  auspices—by means of which Bibulus tried
                                                  to invalidate the laws and other,acta,of Caesar—and
                                                  with the armed forces which Pompey brought into
                                                  the,campus,, nominally
                                                  to keep order, but really to overawe the,comitia,, and secure the
                                                  passing of Caesar's laws. Nor was it in his nature
                                                  to conceal his feelings. Speaking early in the
                                                  year in defence of his former colleague, C.
                                                  Antonius, accused of,maiestas,for his conduct in,Macedonia,, he
                                                  expressed in no doubtful terms his view of the
                                                  political situation. Within a few hours the words
                                                  were reported to the triumvirs, and all
                                                  formalities were promptly gone through for the
                                                  adoption of Clodius. Caesar himself presided at
                                                  the,comitia,,curiata,,
                                                  Pompey attended as augur, and the thing was done
                                                  in a few minutes. Even then Cicero does not appear
                                                  to have been alarmed, or to have been fully aware
                                                  of what the object of Publius was. While on his
                                                  usual spring visit to his seaside villas in April
                                                  (B.C. 59), he expressed
                                                  surprise at hearing from the young Curio that
                                                  Clodius was a candidate for the tribuneship (vol.
                                                  i., p.99). His surprise no doubt was more or less
                                                  assumed: he must have understood that Clodius's
                                                  object in the adoption was the tribunate, and must
                                                  have had many uneasy reflexions as to the use
                                                  which he would make of the office when he got it.
                                                  Indeed there was not very much doubt about it, for
                                                  Publius openly avowed his intentions. We have
                                                  accordingly numerous references, in the letters to
                                                  Atticus, to Cicero's doubts about the course he
                                                  ought to adopt. Should he accept Caesar's offer of
                                                  a legation in,Gaul,, or a free and votive legation?
                                                  Should he stay in,Rome,and fight it out? The latter
                                                  course was the one on which he was still resolved
                                                  in July, when Clodius had been, or was on the
                                                  point of being, elected tribune (p. 110). He
                                                  afterwards wavered (p.113), but was encouraged by
                                                  the belief that all the ""orders"" were favourable
                                                  to him, and were becoming alienated from the
                                                  triumvirs (pp. 117, 119), especially after the
                                                  affair of Vettius (pp.122-124), and by the
                                                  friendly disposition of many of the colleagues of
                                                  Clodius in the tribuneship. With such feelings of
                                                  confidence and courage the letters of B.C. 59 come to an end.,,,The Exile, April, B. C. 58-August, B. C.
                                                  57.,The correspondence only opens again in April of
                                                  B.C. 58, when the worst
                                                  has happened. Clodius entered upon his tribuneship
                                                  on the 10th of December, B.C.
                                                  59, and lost little time in proposing a law
                                                  to the,comitia,for
                                                  the trial of any magistrate guilty of putting
                                                  citizens to death without trial (,qui,,cives,,indemnatos,,necavisset,). The wording of the law thus
                                                  left it open to plead that it applied only to such
                                                  act as occurred after its enactment, for the

                                                  perfect in a direct one. And this was the
                                                  interpretation that Caesar, while approving the
                                                  law itself, desired to put upon it.,insert_note_753,7,He again offered Cicero a
                                                  legation in,Gaul,, but would do nothing for him if
                                                  he stayed in,Rome,; while Pompey, who had been
                                                  profuse in promises of protection, either avoided
                                                  seeing Cicero, or treated his abject entreaties
                                                  with cold disdain.,insert_note_765,8,Every citizen, by a humane custom at,Rome,, had the right
                                                  of avoiding a prosecution by quitting the city and
                                                  residing in some town which had the,ius,,exilii,. It is this course
                                                  that we find Cicero already entered upon when the
                                                  correspondence of the year begins. In the letters
                                                  of this year of exile he continually reproaches
                                                  himself with not having stayed and even supported
                                                  the law, in full confidence that it could not be
                                                  applied to himself. He attributes his having taken
                                                  the less courageous course to the advice of his
                                                  friends, who were actuated by jealousy and a
                                                  desire to get rid of him. Even Atticus he thinks
                                                  was timid, at the best, in advising his
                                                  retirement. It is the only occasion in all the
                                                  correspondence in which the least cloud seems to
                                                  have rested on the perfect friendship of the two
                                                  men. Atticus does not appear to have shown any
                                                  annoyance at the querulous remarks of his friend.
                                                  He steadily continued to write, giving information
                                                  and advice, and made no difficulty in supplying
                                                  his friend with money. During Cicero's absence
                                                  Atticus became still more wealthy than before by
                                                  inheriting the estates of his cross-grained uncle
                                                  Caecilius. But he was always careful as to the
                                                  investment of his money and he would not, perhaps,
                                                  have been so ready to trust Cicero, had he not
                                                  felt confidence in the ultimate recovery of his
                                                  civil status. Still his confidence was peculiarly
                                                  welcome at a time which would have been otherwise
                                                  one of great pressure. For Clodius had followed up
                                                  Cicero's retirement with the usual,lex,in regard to persons
                                                  leaving,Rome,to avoid a trial—a
                                                  prohibition ""of fire and water"" within a fixed
                                                  distance from,Italy,, which involved the
                                                  confiscation of all his property in,Italy,. His villas
                                                  were dismantled, his town house pulled down, and a
                                                  vote of the people obtained by Clodius for the
                                                  consecration of its site as a,templum,dedicated to Liberty, and a
                                                  scheme was formed and the work actually commenced
                                                  for occupying part of it by an extension of an
                                                  existing porticus or colonnade (the,porticus,,Catuli,) to contain a
                                                  statue of Liberty. That this consecration was
                                                  regular is shown by the pleas by which it was
                                                  afterwards sought to reverse it.,insert_note_807,9,When
                                                  Cicero was recalled the question came before the
                                                  pontifices, who decided that the consecration was
                                                  not valid unless it had been done by the ""order of
                                                  the people."" It could not be denied on the face of
                                                  it that there had been such an order. Cicero was
                                                  obliged to resort to the plea that Clodius's
                                                  adoption had been irregular and invalid, that
                                                  therefore he was not legally a tribune, and could
                                                  not take an order of the people. Finally, the
                                                  senate seems to have decided that its restoration
                                                  to Cicero was part of the general,restitutio,,in,,integrum,voted
                                                  by the,comitia,,centuriata,; and a sum of money was
                                                  assigned to him for the rebuilding of the house.
                                                  Clodius refused to recognize the validity of this
                                                  decree of the senate, and attempted by violence to
                                                  interrupt the workmen engaged on the house. We
                                                  have a lively picture of this in Letter XCI (vol.
                                                  i., pp. 194-196).,,,Letters of the Exile (Letters
                                                  LV-LXXXVIII).,The letters from Cicero as an exile are painful
                                                  reading for those who entertain a regard for his
                                                  character. It was not unnatural, indeed, that he
                                                  should feel it grievously. He had so completely
                                                  convinced himself of the extraordinary value of
                                                  his services to the state, of the importance of
                                                  his position in Roman politics, and of the view
                                                  that the Optimates would take of the necessity of
                                                  retaining him, that to see himself treated like a
                                                  fraudulent or unsuccessful provincial governor, of
                                                  no importance to anyone but himself, was a bitter
                                                  blow to his self-esteem. The actual loss was
                                                  immense. His only means were now the amount of
                                                  money he had been able to take with him, or was
                                                  able to borrow. All was gone except such property
                                                  as his wife retained in her own right. He was a
                                                  dependent upon her, instead of being her support
                                                  and the master of his own household. The services
                                                  of freedmen—readily rendered when he was
                                                  prosperous—would now be a matter of
                                                  favour and personal attachment, which was not
                                                  always sufficient to retain them. The ""life and
                                                  light"" of the city, in which no man ever took a
                                                  more eager interest and delight, were closed to
                                                  him. He was cut off from his family, and from
                                                  familiar intercourse with friends, on both of
                                                  which he was much dependent for personal
                                                  happiness. Lastly, wherever he lived, he lived, as
                                                  it were, on sufferance, no longer an object of
                                                  respect as a statesman, or the source of help to
                                                  others by his eloquence. But, disagreeable as all
                                                  this was to a man of Cicero's sensitive vanity,
                                                  there was something still worse. Even in towns
                                                  which were the legal distance from,Italy,he could not
                                                  safely stay, if they were within the jurisdiction
                                                  of one of his personal enemies, or contained other
                                                  exiles, who owed him an ill turn. He was protected
                                                  by no law, and more than one instance of such a
                                                  man's falling a victim to an enemy's dagger is
                                                  recorded. Cicero's first idea was to go to,Malta,:
                                                  but,Malta,was for some purposes in the jurisdiction of the
                                                  governor of,Sicily,, and the governor of,Sicily,(C. Vergilius),insert_note_855,10,objected to his passing
                                                  through,Sicily,or staying at,Malta,. We have no
                                                  reason for supposing Vergilius personally hostile
                                                  to Cicero, but he may have thought that Cicero's
                                                  services to the Sicilians in the Case of Verres
                                                  would have called out some expression of feeling
                                                  on their part in his favour, which would have been
                                                  awkward for a Roman governor. Cicero therefore
                                                  crossed to,Epirus,, and travelled down the
                                                  Egnatian road to,Thessalonica,. This was the official
                                                  capital of the province of,Macedonia,, and the
                                                  quaestor in,Macedonia,, Gnaeus Plancius, met
                                                  Cicero at,Dyrrachium,, invited him to fix his
                                                  residence there with him, and accompanied him on
                                                  his journey. Here he stayed till November in a
                                                  state of anxiety and distress, faithfully
                                                  reflected in his letters, waiting to hear how far
                                                  the elections for B.C. 57
                                                  would result in putting his friends in office, and
                                                  watching for any political changes that would
                                                  favour his recall: but prepared to go still
                                                  farther to,Cyzicus,, if the incoming governor, L.
                                                  Calpurnius Piso, who, as consul in B.C. 58 with Gabinius, had
                                                  shown decided animus against him, should still
                                                  retain that feeling in,Macedonia,. Events,
                                                  however, in,Rome,during the summer and autumn of
                                                  B.C. 58 gave him better
                                                  hopes. Clodius, by his violent proceedings, as
                                                  well as by his legislation, had alienated Pompey,
                                                  and caused him to favour Cicero's recall. Of the
                                                  new consuls Lentulus was his friend, and Q.
                                                  Caecilius Metellus Nepos (who as tribune in
                                                  B.C. 63—62 had
                                                  prevented his speech when laying down his
                                                  consulship) consented to waive all opposition. A
                                                  majority of the new tribunes were also favourable
                                                  to him, especially P. Sestius and T. Annius Milo;
                                                  and in spite of constant ups and downs in his
                                                  feelings of confidence, he had on the whole
                                                  concluded that his recall was certain to take
                                                  place. Towards the end of November he therefore
                                                  travelled back to,Dyrrachium,, a,libera,,civitas,in which he had many
                                                  friends, and where he thought he might be safe,
                                                  and from which he could cross to,Italy,as soon as he
                                                  heard of the law for his recall having been
                                                  passed. Here, however, he was kept waiting through
                                                  many months of anxiety. Clodius had managed to
                                                  make his recall as difficult as possible. He had,
                                                  while tribune, obtained an order from the people
                                                  forbidding the consuls to bring the subject before
                                                  the senate, and Piso and Gabinius had during their
                                                  year of office pleaded that law as a bar to
                                                  introducing the question.,,,The Recall, August, B. C. 57.,The new consuls were not, or did not consider
                                                  themselves, so bound, and Lentulus having brought
                                                  the subject forward, the senate early passed a
                                                  resolution that Cicero's recall was to take
                                                  precedence of all other business. In accordance
                                                  with the resolution of the senate, a law was
                                                  proposed by the consul Lentulus in the,comitia,,centuriata,, and
                                                  probably one by Milo to the,tributa,. But Clodius, though no longer
                                                  armed with the tribuneship, was not yet beaten. He
                                                  obtained the aid of some gladiators belonging to
                                                  his brother Appius, and more than once interrupted
                                                  and dispersed an assembly of the,comitia,. In the riots thus
                                                  occasioned blood was shed on both sides, and
                                                  Cicero's brother Quintus on one occasion nearly
                                                  lost his life. This was the beginning of the
                                                  series of violent contests between Clodius and
                                                  Milo, only ended by the murder of the former on
                                                  the Appian road in B.C.
                                                  52. But Clodius was a candidate for the
                                                  aedileship in this year (B.C.
                                                  57), and could be barred from that office
                                                  legally by a prosecution for,vis,, of which Milo gave notice against
                                                  him. It was, perhaps, a desire to avoid this, as
                                                  much as fear of Milo's counter exhibition of
                                                  violence, that at length caused him to relax in
                                                  his opposition, or at any rate to abstain from
                                                  violently interrupting the,comitia,. Accordingly, on the 4th of
                                                  August, the law proposed by both consuls, and
                                                  supported by Pompey, was passed unanimously by the
                                                  centuries. Cicero, we must presume, had received
                                                  trustworthy information that this was to be the
                                                  case (showing that some understanding had been
                                                  come to with Clodius, or there would have been no
                                                  certainty of his not violently dispersing the,comitia,again), for
                                                  on that same day he set sail from,Dyrrachium,and
                                                  landed at,Brundisium,on the 5th. His triumphant
                                                  return to,Rome,is described in the eighty-ninth
                                                  letter of this collection. For Pompey's share in
                                                  securing it he expressed, and seems really to have
                                                  felt, an exaggerated gratitude, which still
                                                  influenced him in the unhappy months of B.C. 49, when he was hesitating
                                                  as to joining him beyond seas in the civil
                                                  war.,But though Clodius had somehow been prevented
                                                  from hindering his recall, he by no means relaxed
                                                  his hostility. He not only tried to excite the
                                                  populace against him by arguing that the scarcity
                                                  and consequent high price of corn, from which the
                                                  people were at that time suffering, was in some
                                                  way attributable to Cicero's policy, but he also
                                                  opposed the restoration of his house; and when a
                                                  decree of the senate was passed in Cicero's favour
                                                  on that point, brought his armed ruffians to
                                                  prevent the workmen from going on with the
                                                  rebuilding, as well as to molest Cicero himself
                                                  (vol. i., p.195). This was followed by a
                                                  determined opposition by,Milo,to the holding
                                                  of the elections for B.C.
                                                  56, until his prosecution of Clodius,de,,vi,should have
                                                  been tried. Clodius, however, was acquitted,insert_note_973,11,, and, being elected aedile,
                                                  immediately commenced a counter accusation against
                                                  Milo for,vis,. He
                                                  impeached him before the,comitia,in February (B.C. 56), on which occasion Pompey spoke
                                                  in Milo's defence in the midst of a storm of
                                                  interruptions got up by the friends of Clodius
                                                  (vol. i., pp.214, 217). Milo was also acquitted,
                                                  and the rest of Clodius's aedileship seems to have
                                                  passed without farther acts of open violence.,,,Cicero and the Triumvirs.,But Cicero had now other causes of anxiety. He
                                                  had spoken in favour of the commission offered to
                                                  Pompey in B.C. 57 for
                                                  superintending the corn-supply of,Rome,(,cura,,annonae,). Pompey was to
                                                  have fifteen legates, a good supply of ships and
                                                  men, and considerable powers in all corn-growing
                                                  countries in the Mediterranean. Cicero supported
                                                  this, partly from gratitude to Pompey, but partly
                                                  also from a wish to promote his power and
                                                  influence against the ever-increasing influence
                                                  and fame of Caesar. He secretly hoped that a
                                                  jealousy might grow up between them; that Pompey
                                                  would be drawn closer to the Optimates; and that
                                                  the union of the triumvirate might be gradually
                                                  weakened and finally disappear. Pompey was
                                                  thoroughly offended and alarmed by the insults
                                                  offered him by the Clodian mob, and by Clodius's
                                                  own denunciations of him; and if he could be
                                                  convinced that these were suggested or approved by
                                                  Caesar or Crassus, it would go far to withdraw him
                                                  from friendship with either of them. With Crassus,
                                                  indeed, he had never been on cordial terms: it was
                                                  only Caesar's influence that had caused him to
                                                  form any union with him. Caesar, on the other
                                                  hand, was likely to be uneasy at the great powers
                                                  which the,cura,,annonae,put into Pompey's hands; and at
                                                  the possible suggestion of offering him the
                                                  dictatorship, if the Clodian riots became quite
                                                  intolerable. On the whole, Cicero thought that he
                                                  saw the element of a very pretty quarrel, from
                                                  which he hoped that the result might be ""liberty

                                                  rate of anyone of the popular party. He had,
                                                  however, a delicate part to play. He did not wish
                                                  or dare to break openly with Caesar, or to speak
                                                  too openly to Pompey; and he was conscious that
                                                  the intemperance, folly, or indifference of many
                                                  of the Optimates made it difficult to reckon on
                                                  their support, and made that support a very
                                                  questionable benefit if accorded. But though his
                                                  letters of this period are full of expressions
                                                  indicating doubt of Pompey and irritation with
                                                  him, yet he seems still to have spoken of him with
                                                  warmth on public occasions, while he avoided
                                                  mentioning Caesar, or spoke of him only in cold

                                                  policy.,The hope, however, of detaching Pompey from
                                                  Caesar was dashed by the meeting at,Luca,in April,B.C. 56, at which a fresh
                                                  arrangement was made for the mutual advantage of
                                                  the triumvirs. Caesar got the promise of the
                                                  introduction of a law giving him an additional
                                                  five years of command in,Gaul,, with special
                                                  privileges as to his candidature for the
                                                  consulship of B.C. 48;
                                                  while Pompey and Crassus bargained for a second
                                                  consulship in B.C. 55,
                                                  and the reversion of the Spains (to be held as a
                                                  single province) and,Syria,respectively, each for five
                                                  years. The care taken that none of the three
                                                  should have imperium overlapping that of the
                                                  others was indeed a sign of mutual distrust and
                                                  jealousy. But the bargain was made with sufficient

                                                  secure its being carried out by the comitia. The
                                                  union seemed stronger than ever; and Cicero at
                                                  length resolved on a great change of attitude.
                                                  Opposition to the triumvirs had been abandoned, he
                                                  saw, by the very party for whom he had been
                                                  incurring the enmity of Pompey and Caesar. Why
                                                  should he hold out any longer? ""Since those who
                                                  have no power,"" he writes to Atticus in April,

                                                  letters of the change. But it was soon to be
                                                  publicly avowed. The opposition to the consulship
                                                  of Pompey and Crassus was so violent that no

                                                  Caesar, and to support his continuance in the

                                                  front is contained in a long letter to P. Lentulus
                                                  Spinther, written two years afterwards.,insert_note_1064,14,The gist of it is much the same
                                                  as the remark to Atticus already quoted. ""Pompey
                                                  and Caesar were all-powerful, and could not be
                                                  resisted without civil violence, if not downright
                                                  civil war. The Optimates were feeble and shifty,
                                                  had shown ingratitude to Cicero himself, and had
                                                  openly favoured his enemy Clodius. Public peace
                                                  and safety must be the statesman's chief object,
                                                  and almost any concession was to be preferred to
                                                  endangering these."" Nevertheless, we cannot think
                                                  that Cicero was ever heartily reconciled to the
                                                  policy, or the unconstitutional preponderance of
                                                  the triumvirs. He patched up some sort of
                                                  reconciliation with Crassus, and his personal
                                                  affection for Pompey made it comparatively easy
                                                  for him to give him a kind of support. Caesar was
                                                  away, and a correspondence filled on both sides
                                                  with courteous expressions could be maintained
                                                  without seriously compromising his convictions.
                                                  But Cicero was never easy under the yoke. From
                                                  B.C. 55 to B.C. 52 he sought several
                                                  opportunities for a prolonged stay in the country,
                                                  devoting himself—in default of
                                                  politics—to literature. The fruits of
                                                  this were the de Oratore and the de Republica,
                                                  besides poems on his own times and on his
                                                  consulship. Still he was obliged from time to time
                                                  to appear in the forum and senate-house, and in
                                                  various ways to gratify Pompey and Caesar. It must
                                                  have been a great strain upon his loyalty to this
                                                  new political friendship when, in B.C. 54, Pompey called upon him
                                                  to undertake the defence of P. Vatinius, whom he
                                                  had not long before attacked so fiercely while
                                                  defending Sestius. Vatinius had been a tribune in
                                                  B.C. 59, acting entirely
                                                  in Caesar's interests, and Cicero believed him to
                                                  have been his enemy both in the matter of his
                                                  exile and in the opposition to his recall. He had
                                                  denounced him in terms that would have made it
                                                  almost impossible, one would think, to have spoken
                                                  in his defence in any cause whatever. At best he
                                                  represented all that Cicero most disliked in
                                                  politics; and on this very election, to the
                                                  praetorship, for which he was charged with bribery
                                                  (,de,,sodalitiis,),
                                                  Cicero had already spoken in strongly hostile
                                                  terms in the senate. For now undertaking his
                                                  defence he has, in fact, no explanation to give to
                                                  Lentulus (vol. i., p.319), and he was long sore at
                                                  having been forced to do it. Through B.C. 54 and 53 he was busied
                                                  with his de Republica, and was kept more in touch
                                                  with Caesar by the fact that his brother Quintus
                                                  was serving as legatus to the latter in,Britain,and,Gaul,, and
                                                  that his,Quintus
                                                  Cicero in,Gaul,.,friend Trebatius
                                                  (introduced by himself) was seeking for promotion
                                                  and profit in Caesar's camp. But even his
                                                  brother's service with Caesar did not eventually
                                                  contribute to the formation of cordial feeling on
                                                  his part towards Caesar, whom he could not help
                                                  admiring, but never really liked. For Quintus,
                                                  though he distinguished himself by his defence of
                                                  his camp in the autumn of B.C.
                                                  54, lost credit and subjected himself to
                                                  grave rebuke by the disaster incurred in B.C. 53, near Aduatuca

                                                  disregarding an express order of Caesar's. There
                                                  is no allusion to this in the extant
                                                  correspondence, but a fragment of letter from
                                                  Caesar to Cicero (neque pro cauto ac diligente se

                                                  Caesar had written sharply to Cicero on his
                                                  brother's faux pas, and after this time, though
                                                  Cicero met Caesar at,Ravenna,in B.C. 52, and consented to
                                                  support the bill allowing him to stand for the

                                                  tone of former times. But of course there were

                                                  revive again; and made him draw more and more

                                                  seems to have placed all his hopes on Pompey.

                                                  itself, but of supreme interest to Cicero, and
                                                  very fortunate for the readers of the
                                                  correspondence. One of Pompey's new laws ordained
                                                  that no one was to take a province till the fifth
                                                  year after laying down his consulship or
                                                  praetorship. Pompey broke his own law by keeping
                                                  his province, the Spains—his position in
                                                  regard to them was altogether
                                                  exceptional—but, in order to carry out
                                                  the law in other cases, the senate arranged that
                                                  ex-consuls and ex-praetors who had not been to
                                                  provinces should in turn draw lots for vacant
                                                  governorships. Cicero and Bibulus appear to have
                                                  been the senior consulares in that position, and
                                                  with much reluctance Cicero allowed his name to be
                                                  cast into the urn. He drew,Cilicia,and Bibulus
                                                  Syria. He says that his motive was a desire to
                                                  obey the wishes of the senate. Another motive may
                                                  have been a desire to be away from,Rome,while the
                                                  controversy as to Caesar's retirement from his

                                                  of some political importance, which he had
                                                  certainly not increased during the last few years.
                                                  When it came to the actual start, however, he felt
                                                  all the gêne of the
                                                  business—the formation and control of

                                                  residence far from the ""light and life"" of,Rome,,
                                                  among officials who were certainly commonplace and
                                                  probably corrupt, and amidst a population, perhaps
                                                  acute and accomplished, but certainly servile and
                                                  ill content, and in some parts predatory and
                                                  barbarous. At the best, they would be emphatically
                                                  provincial, in a dreary sense of the word. He felt
                                                  unequal to the worry and bore of the whole
                                                  business, and reproached himself with the folly of
                                                  the undertaking. Of course, this regret is mingled
                                                  with his usual self-congratulation on the purity
                                                  with which he means to manage his province. But
                                                  even that feeling is not strong enough to prevent
                                                  his longing earnestly to have the period of
                                                  banishment as short as possible, or to prevent the
                                                  alarm with which he hears of a probable invasion
                                                  by the Parthians. One effect of his almost two
                                                  years' absence from,Rome,was, I think, to deprive him of
                                                  the power of judging clearly of the course of
                                                  events. He had constant intelligence and excellent
                                                  correspondents—especially
                                                  Caelius—still he could not really grasp
                                                  what was going on under the surface: and when he
                                                  returned to find the civil war on the point of
                                                  breaking out, he was, after all, taken by
                                                  surprise, and had no plan of action ready. This,
                                                  as well as his government of the province, will be
                                                  fully illustrated in the next volume of the
                                                  correspondence.,,,Cicero's Correspondents.,The persons to whom the chief letters are
                                                  addressed in this volume, besides Atticus, are
                                                  Cicero's brother Quintus and P. Lentulus Spinther.
                                                  There are two excellent letters to M. Marius, and
                                                  one very interesting, though rather surprising,
                                                  epistle to L. Lucceius. Others of more than
                                                  average interest are to Terentia, M. Fadius
                                                  Gallus, C. Scribonius Curio, and Tiro. ATTICUS
                                                  (B.C. 109—32) is a
                                                  man of whom we should be glad to know more than we
                                                  do. He was the,Titus Pomponius Atticus.,friend of all the
                                                  leading men of the day— Pompey, Caesar,
                                                  Cicero, Antony, Brutus—father-in-law of
                                                  Agrippa, and survived to be a constant
                                                  correspondent of Augustus, between B.C. 43 and his death in B.C. 32. He was spared and
                                                  respected by both sides in the civil wars, from
                                                  Sulla to the Second Triumvirate. The secret of his
                                                  success seems to have been that he was no man's
                                                  rival. He resolutely declined all official
                                                  employment, even on the staff of his
                                                  brother-in-law Quintus Cicero. He committed
                                                  himself to no side in politics, and, not being in
                                                  the senate, had no occasion by vote or speech to
                                                  wound the feelings of anyone. So, too, though he
                                                  cared for literature, it was rather as a friendly
                                                  critic of others than as an author. He did, it is
                                                  true, compile some books on Roman history, on
                                                  historical portraits, and certain family
                                                  biographies; but they were not such as made him a
                                                  rival of any of his Contemporaries. They were
                                                  rather the productions of a rich amateur, who had
                                                  leisure to indulge a quasi-literary taste, without
                                                  any thought of joining the ranks of professed
                                                  writers. Thirdly, he had great wealth, partly
                                                  inherited, partly acquired by prudent speculation
                                                  in the purchase of town properties, or in loans to
                                                  states or public bodies on fair terms: and this
                                                  wealth was at the service of his friends, but not
                                                  in the lavish or reckless manner, which often
                                                  earns only ingratitude without being of any
                                                  permanent service to the recipients. He lent
                                                  money, but expected to be repaid even by his
                                                  brother-in-law. And this prudence helped to retain
                                                  the confidence, while his sympathetic temperament
                                                  secured the liking, of most. Again, he had the
                                                  valuable knack of constantly replenishing the
                                                  number of his friends among men junior to himself.
                                                  His character attracted the liking of Sulla, who
                                                  was twenty-seven years his senior, and he remained
                                                  the close friend of his contemporaries Hortensius
                                                  and Cicero (the former five years his senior, the
                                                  latter three years his junior) till the day of
                                                  their death. But we also find him on intimate
                                                  terms with Brutus, twenty-four, and Octavian,
                                                  forty-six years junior to himself. Lastly, he was
                                                  not too much at,Rome,. More than twenty years of his
                                                  earlier manhood (B.C.
                                                  87—65) were
                                                  spent in,Greece,, principally at,Athens,, partly in
                                                  study and partly in business. And,Athens,at this
                                                  time, long deprived of political importance, had
                                                  still the charm not only of its illustrious past,
                                                  but also of its surviving character as the home of
                                                  culture and refinement. When he at length returned
                                                  to,Rome,in B.C. 65, he had
                                                  already purchased a property in,Epirus,, near,Buthrotum,(see p.3), where he built a
                                                  villa, in which he continued to spend a
                                                  considerable part of his remaining years. This was
                                                  sufficiently remote, not only from,Rome,, but from the
                                                  summer residences of the Roman nobles, to secure
                                                  his isolation from the intrigues and enmities of
                                                  Roman society. He did not indeed—as who
                                                  does ?—always escape giving offence. At
                                                  the very beginning of the correspondence we hear
                                                  of his vain attempts to mollify the anger of L.
                                                  Lucceius—how incurred we do not know;
                                                  and Quintus Cicero, of whose sharp temper we hear
                                                  so much, was on more than one occasion on the
                                                  point of a rupture with him. But his family life
                                                  was generally as pleasing as his connexion with
                                                  his friends. With his mother, who lived to a great
                                                  age, he boasted that he had never been reconciled,
                                                  because he had never quarrelled. He was the only
                                                  one who could get on with the crusty uncle
                                                  Caecilius. In the delicate matter of his sister
                                                  Pomponia's differences with her husband Quintus
                                                  Cicero, he seems to have acted with kindness as
                                                  well as prudence; and though he married late in
                                                  life (B.C. 56, when he
                                                  was in his fifty-third year), he appears to have
                                                  made an excellent husband to Pilia and a very
                                                  affectionate father to his daughter. His unwearied
                                                  sympathy with the varied moods of
                                                  Cicero—whether of exultation,
                                                  irritation, or despair—and the entire
                                                  confidence which Cicero feels that he will have
                                                  that sympathy in every case, are creditable to
                                                  both. It is only between sincere souls that one
                                                  can speak to the other as to a second self, as
                                                  Cicero often alleges that he does to Atticus.,Of QUINTUS CICERO, the next most important
                                                  correspondent in this volume, we get a fairly

                                                  the praetorship, to which he was elected in the
                                                  year of his elder's consulship. There, however,
                                                  Quintus stopped. He never seems to have stood for
                                                  the consulship. He had no oratorical genius to
                                                  give him reputation in the forum, nor were his
                                                  literary productions of any value, either for
                                                  style or originality. His abilities for

                                                  government of,Asia,, appear to have been
                                                  respectable, but were marred by faults of temper,
                                                  which too often betrayed him into extreme violence
                                                  of language. In military command he showed courage
                                                  and energy in defending his camp in the rising of
                                                  the Gauls in the winter of B.C. 54—53; but he
                                                  spoilt the reputation thus gained by the mistake
                                                  Committed in the autumn of B.C.
                                                  53, which Cost the loss of a considerable
                                                  number of troops, and all but allowed the roving
                                                  Germans to storm his camp. He remained another
                                                  year in,Gaul,, but did nothing to retrieve
                                                  this mistake. In military affairs fortune rarely
                                                  forgives. In politics he seems to have contented
                                                  himself generally with saying ditto to his
                                                  brother. And this continued to be the case up to
                                                  Pharsalia. After that, finding himself on the
                                                  losing side, he turned somewhat fiercely upon the
                                                  brother, whom he regarded as having misled him;
                                                  and for a time there was a miserable breach
                                                  between them, which, however, did not last very
                                                  long. When the end came it found the brothers
                                                  united in heart as in misfortune. His private
                                                  happiness was marred by an uncongenial marriage.
                                                  Pomponia—sister of
                                                  Atticus—seems to have been as
                                                  high-tempered as her husband, and less placable.
                                                  The constant quarrels between them exercised the
                                                  patience both of Cicero and Atticus, and crops up
                                                  all through the correspondence. One effect of them
                                                  was the loss of all control over their son, who,
                                                  being called upon to smooth over the differences
                                                  between father and mother, naturally took up at an
                                                  early age a line of his own, and showed a
                                                  disposition to act independently of his
                                                  elders.,The letters to TERENTIA do not fill much space

                                                  80, Cicero seems to have lived in harmony
                                                  with her at least till the time of his return from
                                                  exile, during which unhappy period he acknowledges
                                                  the activity of her exertions in support of his
                                                  recall, and the drain which his ruin was making
                                                  upon her resources. Terentia had a large private
                                                  fortune, and apparently used it liberally in his
                                                  service. Nevertheless, immediately on his return
                                                  from exile, there seems to have been some cause of
                                                  coldness between the husband and wife. He darkly
                                                  alludes to certain domestic troubles in the first
                                                  letter to Atticus written from,Rome,(vol i.,
                                                  p.189), and repeats the hint in the next (p.193).
                                                  When he landed at,Brundisium,it was Tullia, not
                                                  Terentia, who came to meet him (p.187), and for
                                                  some time after she appears to be presiding in his
                                                  house rather than Terentia (see pp.224, 257).
                                                  Whatever the cause of this coldness was, however,
                                                  it appears to have been removed for a time. He
                                                  kept up a correspondence with her while he was in,Cilicia,(B.C. 51—50), and
                                                  though he does not seem pleased at her having
                                                  arranged the marriage of Tullia with Dolabella, he
                                                  addresses her warmly when about to return, and was
                                                  met by her on landing. During the five or six
                                                  months that followed, before Cicero left,Italy,to
                                                  join Pompey, there is no indication of any
                                                  alienation: but the short notes from Pompey's
                                                  camp, and in the first half of B.C. 47, are cold and conventional, and on
                                                  his return to,Brundisium,after Pharsalia, and
                                                  during his lengthened stay there, he appears to
                                                  have declined to allow her to come and see him.
                                                  Soon after his return to,Rome,, in September,
                                                  B.C. 47, matters came to
                                                  a climax. Perhaps some of the mischief was caused
                                                  by the mismanagement or dishonesty of Terentia's
                                                  steward, Philotimus, of whom we hear a good deal
                                                  in the letters from,Cilicia,: but whatever was the origin
                                                  of the quarrel, Cicero asserts that on his return
                                                  he found his affairs in a state of utter disorder.
                                                  It may well have been that, like other adherents
                                                  to the losing cause, he had to suffer from loss of
                                                  any property that could be easily laid hands on in,Rome,,
                                                  and that Terentia had had no power to save it. But
                                                  Cicero, rightly or wrongly, attributed the
                                                  embarrassment which he found awaiting him to his
                                                  wife. He says in a letter to Gnaeus Plancius :,insert_note_1263,20,""I should not have taken any new

                                                  saw that, owing to the criminal conduct of those

                                                  rendered still more questionable by a prompt
                                                  marriage with a young girl, rich, and his own
                                                  ward: from whom, however, he soon again divorced
                                                  himself, angered, it is said, by her want of
                                                  feeling at the death of Tullia. Terentia long

                                                  over a hundred years old. Divorce was, of course,
                                                  not regarded in these days of the Republic as it
                                                  had once been, or as it is now among ourselves.

                                                  Lentulus Spinther.,whom some of the longest
                                                  letters are addressed, represents the high
                                                  aristocracy, to which Cicero wished to commend
                                                  himself, though seeing keenly the weakness which
                                                  underlay their magnificence. The part played by
                                                  Lentulus in politics had been showy, but never
                                                  founded on steadfast principle. He owed his
                                                  earlier promotions to Caesar's influence, but in
                                                  his consulship of B.C. 57
                                                  had taken the side of the aristocracy in promoting
                                                  the recall of Cicero, though he had gone against
                                                  their sentiment by supporting Pompey's appointment
                                                  to the,cura,,annonae,.

                                                  have the lucrative task of restoring Ptolemy
                                                  Auletes to the throne of,Egypt,, from which he
                                                  had been righteously driven by his subjects.
                                                  Therefore it was all to the good that Pompey
                                                  should have business at home preventing him from
                                                  taking this in hand. How Lentulus was baulked in
                                                  this desire will appear in the letters. He no
                                                  doubt had his full share of the Lenlulitas
                                                  distinguishing his family. But all was forgiven by
                                                  Cicero to a man who had promoted his recall, and
                                                  he takes great pains to justify to Lentulus his
                                                  own change of policy in regard to the triumvirs
                                                  after B.C. 56. When the
                                                  civil war began Lentulus joined Domitius at,Corfinium,, and with him fell into
                                                  Caesar's hands, and was dismissed unharmed. He
                                                  afterwards joined Pompey in,Epirus,, intent on
                                                  succeeding Caesar as Pontifex Maximus, as soon as
                                                  the latter had been satisfactorily disposed of.
                                                  After Pharsalia he sought refuge at,Rhodes,, but was
                                                  refused sanctuary by the islanders, and was
                                                  eventually put to death, though we do not know by

                                                  remarkable letter begging for an honourable place
                                                  in it for his consulship, as Pliny did to Tacitus.,insert_note_1318,21,C. SCRIBONIUS CURIO, son of a great
                                                  friend of Cicero, after a jeunesse orageuse, returned to,Rome,from his quaestorship in,Asia,, in B.C. 53, to take up the
                                                  inheritance of his father, which he quickly
                                                  dissipated. Cicero seems to have had a high idea
                                                  of his abilities, and to have believed him capable
                                                  of taking the lead of the Optimates. But in his

                                                  51—50 he
                                                  disappointed all such hopes by openly joining
                                                  Caesar's party, and resisting all attempts to
                                                  recall him. He joined Caesar at,Ravenna,as soon
                                                  as his tribuneship was out, and urged him to march
                                                  on,Rome,.
                                                  In B.C. 49 he was sent to
                                                  secure,Sicily,and,Africa,. The first he
                                                  did, but in the second he perished in battle
                                                  against the senatorial governor and king Iuba.
                                                  Cicero's relation to C. TREBATIUS TESTA, a learned
                                                  jurisconsult, was apparently that of a patron or
                                                  tutor, who, thinking that he has found a young man
                                                  of ability, endeavours to push him. He sent him
                                                  with a letter of introduction to Caesar, who was
                                                  good-natured, though rather sarcastic as to the
                                                  scope for legal abilities to be found in,Gaul,. He
                                                  gave him, however, a military tribuneship, without
                                                  exacting military duties, and apparently kept on
                                                  good terms with him, for he employed him in B.C. 49 to communicate his wish

                                                  Trebatius in Caesar's province had not been very
                                                  successful. The friendship, however, survived the
                                                  civil war, and we find Cicero in B.C. 44 dedicating his,Topica,to Trebatius.,,“

Celsus,De Medicina,"Book I, chapter 2","2 The weak, however, among whom are a large portion of townspeople, and almost all those fond of letters, need greater precaution, so that care may re-establish what the character of their constitution or of their residence or of their study detracts. Anyone therefore of these who has digested well may with safety rise early; if too little, he must stay in bed, or if he has been obliged to get up early, must go to sleep again; he who has not digested, should lie up altogether, and neither work nor take exercise nor attend to business. He who without heartburn eructates undigested food should drink cold water at intervals and none the less exercise self-control. He should also reside in a house that is light, airy in summer, sunny in winter; avoid the midday sun, the morning and evening chill, also exhalations from rivers and marshes; and he should not often expose himself when the sky is cloudy to a sun that breaks through . . ., lest he should be affected alternately by cold and heat — a thing which excites [p. 47] particularly choked nostrils and running colds. Much more indeed are these things to be watched in unhealthy localities, where they even produce pestilence. He can tell that his body is sound, if his morning urine is whitish, later reddish; the former indicates that digestion is going on, the latter that digestion is complete. On waking one should lie still for a while, then, except in winter time, bathe the face freely with cold water; when the days are long the siesta should be taken before the midday meal, when short, after it. In winter, it is best to rest in bed the whole night long; if there must be study by lamp-light, it should not be immediately after taking food, but after digestion. He who has been engaged in the day, whether in domestic or on public affairs, ought to keep some portion of the day for the care of the body. The primary care in this respect is exercise, which should always precede the taking of food; the exercise should be ampler in the case of one who has laboured less and digested less well. Useful exercises are: reading aloud, drill, handball, running, walking; but this is not by any means most useful on the level, since walking up and down hill varies the movement of the body, unless indeed the body is thoroughly weak; but it is better to walk in the open air than under cover; better, when the head allows of it, in the sun than in the shade; better under the shade of a wall or of trees than under a roof; better a straight than a winding walk. But the exercise ought to come to an end with sweating, or at any rate lassitude, which should be [p. 49] well this side of fatigue; and sometimes less, sometimes more, is to be done. But in these matters, as before, the example of athletes should not be followed, with their fixed rules and immoderate labour. The proper sequel to exercise is: at times an anointing, whether in the sun or before a brazier; at times a bath, which should be in a chamber as lofty, well lighted and spacious as possible. However, neither should be made use of invariably, but one of the two the oftener, in accordance with the constitution. There is need of a short rest afterwards. Coming to food, a surfeit is never of service, excessive abstinence is often unserviceable; if any intemperance is committed, it is safer in drinking than in eating. It is better to begin a meal with savouries, salads and such-like; and after that meat is to be eaten, best either when roasted or boiled. All preserved fruits are unserviceable for two reasons, because more is taken owing to their sweetness, and even what is moderate is still digested with some difficulty. Dessert does no harm to a good stomach, in a weak one it turns sour. Whoever then in this respect has too little strength, had better eat dates, apples and such-like at the beginning of the meal. After many drinkings which have somewhat exceeded the demands of thirst, nothing should be eaten; after a surfeit of food there should be no exertion. Anyone who has had his fill digests the more readily if he concludes the meal with a drink of cold water, then after keeping awake for a time has a sound sleep. When a full meal is taken at [p. 51] midday, after it there should be no exposure to cold, heat or fatigue, which do not harm the body so easily when it is empty as when it is full. When from whatever causes there is prospective want of food, everything laborious should be avoided.",,"2   The weak, however, among whom are a large portion of townspeople, and almost all those fond of letters, need greater precaution, so that care may re-establish what the character of their constitution or of their residence or of their study detracts. Anyone therefore of these who has digested well may with safety rise early; if too little, he must stay in bed, or if he has been obliged to get up early, must go to sleep again; he who has not digested, should lie up altogether, and neither work nor take exercise nor attend to business. He who without heartburn eructates undigested food should drink cold water at intervals and none the less exercise self-control.,He should also reside in a house that is light, airy in summer, sunny in winter; avoid the midday sun, the morning and evening chill, also exhalations from rivers and marshes; and he should not often expose himself when the sky is cloudy to a sun that breaks through . . ., lest he should be affected alternately by cold and heat — a thing which excites,[p. 47],particularly choked nostrils and running colds. Much more indeed are these things to be watched in unhealthy localities, where they even produce pestilence.,He can tell that his body is sound, if his morning urine is whitish, later reddish; the former indicates that digestion is going on, the latter that digestion is complete. On waking one should lie still for a while, then, except in winter time, bathe the face freely with cold water; when the days are long the siesta should be taken before the midday meal, when short, after it. In winter, it is best to rest in bed the whole night long; if there must be study by lamp-light, it should not be immediately after taking food, but after digestion. He who has been engaged in the day, whether in domestic or on public affairs, ought to keep some portion of the day for the care of the body. The primary care in this respect is exercise, which should always precede the taking of food; the exercise should be ampler in the case of one who has laboured less and digested less well.,Useful exercises are: reading aloud, drill, handball, running, walking; but this is not by any means most useful on the level, since walking up and down hill varies the movement of the body, unless indeed the body is thoroughly weak; but it is better to walk in the open air than under cover; better, when the head allows of it, in the sun than in the shade; better under the shade of a wall or of trees than under a roof; better a straight than a winding walk. But the exercise ought to come to an end with sweating, or at any rate lassitude, which should be,[p. 49],well this side of fatigue; and sometimes less, sometimes more, is to be done. But in these matters, as before, the example of athletes should not be followed, with their fixed rules and immoderate labour.

M. Tullius Cicero,Letters,Volume 1,"B.C. 68. Coss., L. Caecilius Metellus, Q. Marcius Rex. B.C. 68. Coss., L. Caecilius Metellus, Q. Marcius Rex. This opening of the correspondence finds Cicero , now in his thirty-ninth year, in the midst of his official career. He had already been quaestor (B.C. 75) and aedile (B.C. 69), and was looking forward to his election to the praetorship in the next year (B.C. 67). He had already risen almost to the highest place in his profession as advocate, and had partly delivered, partly published his great indictment of Verres only a year ago. He is married to Terentia (B.C. 80), and has one daughter, Tullia or Tulliola, born on August 5, probably the next year (B.C. 79). His intimacy with T. Pomponius Atticus (three years his senior), perhaps begun at school, had lasted at least eleven years, from the time when he met him at Athens (B.C. 79), and with him had been initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries (de Leg. 2.). There too they had both seen much of the writer's cousin Lucius , whose death he deplores in this letter ( de Fin. 5.1 ). Atticus had lived abroad in Athens and Epirus , with occasional visits home from B.C. 88 to B.C. 65, in which latter year he seems to have returned for a more lengthened stay ( Nep. Att. 4 ). The two friends have already corresponded frequently, but this is the first letter preserved. I (A I, 5) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME We are such intimate friends that more than almost anyone else you can appreciate the grief as well as the actual public and private loss that the death of my cousin Lucius is to me. There is absolutely no gratification which any human being can receive from the kindly character of another that I have not been accustomed to receive from him. I am sure, therefore, that you will share my grief. For, in the first place, whatever affects me affects you; and in the second place, you have yourself lost in him a friend and connexion of the highest character and most obliging disposition, who was attached to you from personal inclination, as well as from my conversation. As to what you say in your letter about your sister, 1 she will herself bear me witness what pains I have taken that my brother Quintus should show her proper affection. Thinking him somewhat inclined to be angry with her, I wrote to him in such a way as I thought would not hurt his feelings as a brother, while giving him some good advice as my junior, and remonstrating with him as being in the wrong. The result is that, from frequent letters since received from him, I feel confident that everything is as it ought and as we should wish it to be. As to the frequency of my letters you have no ground for your complaint. The fact is our good sister Pomponia never informed me of there being a courier ready to take a letter. Farthermore, I never chanced to know of anyone going to Epirus , 2 and I was not till recently informed of your being at Athens . Again, as to the business of Acutilius which you had left in my hands. I had settled it on my first visit to Rome after your departure. But it turned out that, in the first place, there was no urgency in the matter, and, in the second place, as I felt confidence in your judgment, I preferred that Peducaeus 3 rather than myself should advise you by letter on the subject. For having submitted my ears to Acutilius for several days (and I think you know his style), I should scarcely have regarded it as a hardship to write you a letter describing his grumblings after patiently enduring the bore (and it was rather a bore, I can tell you) of hearing them. Moreover, though you find fault with me, allow me to observe that I have had only one letter from you, though you had greater leisure for writing, and more opportunity of sending letters. As to what you say in your letter, Even if anyone is inclined to be offended with you, I ought to bring him to a better mind —I understand to what you allude, and I have not neglected the matter. But the truth is that the extent of his displeasure is something surprising. However, I have not omitted to say anything there was to say in your behalf: but on what points I am to hold out your wishes, I consider, ought to be my guide. If you will write me word distinctly what they are, you will find that I have had no desire to be more exacting, and in the future shall be no more yielding, than you wish. 4 As to the business of Tadius. He tells me that you have written him word that there was no need of farther trouble, since the property is secured by prescription. I am surprised that you do not know that in the case of a statutory wardship of an unmarried girl prescription cannot be pleaded. 5 I am glad you like your purchase in Epirus . What I commissioned you to get for me, and anything you see suitable to my Tusculan villa, I should be glad if you will, as you say in your letter, procure for me, only don't put yourself to any inconvenience. The truth is, there is no other place that gives me complete rest after all my worries and hard work. I am expecting my brother Quintus every day. Terentia has a severe attack of rheumatism. She is devoted to you, to your sister, and your mother, and adds her kindest regards in a postscript. So does my pet Tulliola. Love me, and be assured that I love you as a brother. II (A I, 6) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME , DECEMBER I won¹t give you any excuse hereafter for accusing me of neglecting to write. It is you that must take care that with all your leisure you keep up with me. Rabirius's house at Naples , 6 for the improvement of which you have designs drawn out and completed in imagination, has been bought by M. Fonteius 7 for 130,000 sesterces. I wished you to know this in case you were still hankering after it. We may be quite satisfied, I think, with my brother's feelings towards Pomponia He is with her at present in his villa at Arpinum, and has Decimus Turanius with him, who is great in belles lettres. The date of my father's death was the 28th of November. That is about all my news. If you light on any articles of vertu suitable for a gymnasium, which would look well in the place you know of; 8 please don't let them slip. I am so delighted with my Tusculan villa that I never feel really happy till I get there. Let me know exactly what you are doing and intending to do about everything. III (A I, 7) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME , DECEMBER All's well at your mother's, 9 and I keep an eye on her. I have undertaken to pay L. Cincius 20,400 sesterces 10 to your credit on the Ides of February. Pray see that I receive at the earliest possible opportunity what you say in your letters that you have bought and secured for me. I should also be very much obliged if you would, as you promised, think over the means of securing the library for me. My hope of getting the one enjoyment which I care for, when I come to retire, depends entirely on your kindness.","Note: 1  Pomponia , married to                                                   Cicero's younger brother Quintus.

                                                  career. He had already been quaestor (B.C. 75) and aedile (B.C. 69), and was looking
                                                  forward to his election to the praetorship in the

                                                  had already risen almost to the highest place in

                                                  eleven years, from the time when he met him at,Athens,(B.C. 79), and with him

                                                  from B.C. 88 to B.C. 65, in which latter year

                                                  show her proper affection. Thinking him somewhat
                                                  inclined to be angry with her, I wrote to him in
                                                  such a way as I thought would not hurt his
                                                  feelings as a brother, while giving him some good

                                                  being in the wrong. The result is that, from
                                                  frequent letters since received from him, I feel
                                                  confident that everything is as it ought and as we

                                                  for your complaint. The fact is our good sister
                                                  Pomponia never informed me of there being a

                                                  of Acutilius which you had left in my hands. I had
                                                  settled it on my first visit to,Rome,after your

                                                  place, there was no urgency in the matter, and, in
                                                  the second place, as I felt confidence in your
                                                  judgment, I preferred that Peducaeus,insert_note_87,3,rather
                                                  than myself should advise you by letter on the

                                                  I should scarcely have regarded it as a hardship
                                                  to write you a letter describing his grumblings

Celsus,De Medicina,Book I,"3 Now the foregoing precepts indeed almost always hold good; but some particular notice requires to be taken of changes of surroundings and varieties of constitution and sex and age and seasons. For it is not safe to remove either from a salubrious to an oppressive locality, or from an oppressive to a salubrious one. It is better to make the move from a salubrious into an oppressive place at the beginning of winter, from an oppressive into a salubrious one in early summer. It is not good indeed to overeat after a long fast, nor to fast after overeating. And he runs a risk who goes contrary to his habit and eats immoderately whether once or twice in the day. Again, neither sudden idleness after excessive labour, nor sudden labour after excessive idleness, is without serious harm. Therefore when a man wishes to make a change, he ought to habituate himself little by little; indeed any work is easier even for a boy or an old man than for an unaccustomed adult. Hence also too idle a life is inexpedient, because there may come up some necessity for labour. But if at any time a man has had to undergo unaccustomed labour, or at any rate much more than he is used to, he should go to bed on an empty stomach, more especially if he has a bitter taste in his mouth, or his eyes are dimmed, or his bowels disturbed; for then he must not only sleep with his stomach empty, but even remain at rest over the next day, unless rest has quickly removed the trouble; in this case [p. 53] he should get up and take slowly a short walk. But even when there has been no necessity for a sleep, because a man has only done more moderate work, still he ought, all the same, to take a little walk. This then should be the rule for everyone after incurring fatigue before taking food: first to walk about a little, then, if no bath is at hand, to undergo anointing and sweating in a warm place whether in the sun or before a fire; when there is a bath, he should first sit in the warm room, then, after resting there a while, go down into the tubs; next, after being anointed freely with oil and gently rubbed down, again descend into the tub; finally he should foment the face, first with warm, then with cold water. A very hot bath does not suit such cases. Therefore if one's excessive fatigue almost amounts to a fever, it is quite sufficient for him to sit in warm water, to which a little oil may be added, up to the groins, in a tepid room; next his whole body, and especially the parts which have been under water, should be rubbed gently with oil to which a little wine and pounded salt have been added. This done, anybody who has undergone fatigue is ready for food, in particular food of a fluid consistency; he should be content with water to drink, or if wine, certainly diluted, of the sort to promote diuresis. Further it should be recognized that after labour accompanied by sweating a cold drink is most pernicious, and even although sweating after a fatiguing journey has passed off, it is unserviceable. After coming out of the bath, too, Asclepiades held it unserviceable; and this is true in the case of those whose bowels are loose at uncertain moments, and who readily shiver; but it is not the universal rule [p. 55] in all cases, since it is more natural that a heated stomach should be cooled, and a cold one warmed by a drink. I grant so much, but I hesitate to give this as a rule, for as a matter of fact a cold drink is bad while sweating. It also happens that after a dinner of many courses and many drinks of diluted wine a vomit is even advantageous; the next day there should be a prolonged rest followed by exercise in moderation. If there is oppression due to a persistence of fatigue, water and wine should be drunk alternately, but the bath seldom used. A change of work, too, relieves lassitude; and when a novel form of customary work has tired a man, that form to which he is accustomed restores him. To one who is fatigued that couch is best which he uses every day; for whether soft or hard, one to which he is unaccustomed wearies him. Certain things are specially applicable to one who is fatigued whilst travelling on foot. To be rubbed often while actually on the way restores him; after the journey he should sit awhile, then undergo anointing; next at the bath foment with hot water his upper rather than his lower parts. But anyone who has become overheated in the sun should go at once to the bath, and there have oil poured over the head and body; next go down to a thoroughly hot tub; then have water poured over his head freely, first hot, next cold. On the other hand, he who has become much chilled should first sit in the calidarium, well wrapped up, until he sweats; next be anointed, afterwards laved, then take food in moderation and after that drinks of undiluted wine. He too who on a voyage is troubled by seasickness, if he has vomited out a quantity of bile, should fast or take very little food. If he has spewed [p. 57] out sour phlegm, he may take food notwithstanding, but lighter than usual; if he has nausea without vomiting, he should either fast, or after food excite a vomit. But he who has spent all day sitting in a carriage or at the games should not after that hurry but walk slowly; also it is of service to linger somewhat in the bath, and then take a small dinner afterwards. When overheated in the bath, taking vinegar and holding it in the mouth restores him; if that is not at hand, cold water may be taken in the same way. But above all things everyone should be acquainted with the nature of his own body, for some are spare, others obese; some hot, others more frigid; some moist, others dry; some are costive, in others the bowels are loose. It is seldom but that a man has some part of his body weak. So then a thin man ought to fatten himself up, a stout one to thin himself down; a hot man to cool himself, a cold man to make himself warmer; the moist to dry himself up, the dry to moisten himself; he should render firmer his motions if loose, relax them if costive; treatment is to be always directed to the part which is mostly in trouble. Now the body is fattened: by moderate exercise, by oftener resting, by anointing, and by the bath if after a meal at midday; by the bowels being confined, by winter cold in moderation, by sleep adequate but not over long, by a soft couch, by a tranquil spirit, by food whether solid or fluid which is sweet and fatty; by meals rather frequent and as large as it is possible to digest. The body is thinned: by hot water if one bathes in it and especially if salt; by the bath on an empty stomach, by a scorching sun, by heat of all kinds, by worry, by late nights; by sleep unduly short or overlong, by a hard bed throughout the summer; by running or much walking or any violent exercise; by a vomit, by purgation, by sour and harsh things consumed; by a single meal a day; by the custom of drinking wine not too cold upon an empty stomach. But as I have mentioned a vomit and a purge among thinning measures, there are some things to be said in particular concerning them. I note that a vomit was rejected by Asclepiades in the book written by him, entitled De tuenda sanitate; I do not blame him for being disquieted with the custom of those, who by ejecting every day achieve a capacity for gormandizing. He has even gone somewhat further; for from the same volume he has expelled likewise purgings; which indeed are pernicious when procured by too powerful medicaments. Such measures, however, are not to be dispensed with entirely, because regard for different constitutions and times can make them necessary, provided that they are employed in moderation and only when needed. Hence Asclepiades has himself allowed that what is already corrupted ought to be expelled: so this kind of treatment is not wholly to be condemned. But there may be more than one reason for this too; and so a somewhat closer consideration may be given to the matter. A vomit is more advantageous in winter than in summer, for then more phlegm and severer stuffiness in the head occur. It is unsuitable for the thin and for those with a weak stomach, but suitable for the plethoric, and all who have become bilious, whether after overeating or imperfect digestion. For if the meal has been larger than can be digested, it is not [p. 61] well to risk its corruption; and if it has already become corrupted, nothing is more to the purpose than to eject it by whatever way its expulsion is first possible. When, therefore, there are bitter eructations, with pain and weight over the heart, recourse should be had at once to a vomit, which is likewise of service to anyone who has heartburn and copious salivation or nausea, or ringing in the ears, or watering of the eyes, or a bitter taste in the mouth; similarly in the case of one who is making a change of climate or locality; as well as in the case of those who become troubled by pain over the heart when they have not vomited for several days. Nor am I unaware that in such cases there is prescribed rest, but that is not always within the reach of those who are obliged to be busy; nor does rest act in the same way with everybody. Accordingly I allow that vomiting should not be practised for the sake of luxury; on account of health I believe from experiment that it is sometimes rightly practised, nevertheless with this reservation, that no one who wants to keep well, and live to old age, should make it a daily habit. He who after a meal wants to vomit, if he does so easily should first take tepid water by itself; when there is more difficulty, a little salt or honey should be added. To cause a vomit on getting up in the morning, he should first drink some honey or hyssop in wine, or eat a radish, and after that drink tepid water as described above. The other emetics prescribed by the ancient practitioners all disturb the stomach. After a vomit, when the stomach is weak, a little suitable food should be taken, and for drink, unless the vomiting has made the throat raw, three cupfuls of cold water. He who has provoked [p. 63] a vomit, if it be early in the day, should after that take a walk, next undergo anointing, then dine; if after dining, he should the next day bathe, or sweat in the baths. After that the following meal had better be a light one, consisting of bread a day old, harsh undiluted wine, roasted meat, all food being of the dryest. Whoever aims to provoke a vomit twice a month, had better arrange to do so on two consecutive days, rather than once a fortnight, unless this longer interval causes heaviness in the chest. Now defaecation is to be procured also by a medicament, when, the bowels being costive, too little is passed, with the result that there is increase of flatulence, dizziness of vision, headaches, and other disturbances in the upper parts. For what can rest and fasting help in such circumstances which come about so much through them? He who wants to defaecate should in the first place make use of such food and wine as will promote it; then if these have little effect, he should take aloes. But purgatives also, whilst necessary at times, when frequently used entail danger; for the body becomes subject to malnutrition, since a weakened state leaves it exposed to maladies of all sorts. The body is heated: by anointing, by salt-water affusion and the more so when hot; by all food which is salt, bitter and fleshy; and after meals by the bath and harsh wine. On the contrary it is cooled: by the bath and sleep on an empty stomach, if not too prolonged; by all sour food; by the coldest water to drink, by oil affusion when mixed with water. The body is rendered humid: by more than customary exertion, by a frequent bath, by food in [p. 65] increased amount, by copious drinking, followed by walking and late hours; much walking, early and forced, has by itself the same effect, food being taken not immediately after exercise; so also those classes of edibles which come from cold and rainy and irrigated localities. On the contrary the body is dried: by moderate exercise, hunger, anointing without the addition of water, summer heat with moderate exposure to the sun, cold water to drink, food immediately after exercise, and all edibles coming from hot and dry districts. The bowels are confined by exertion, by sitting still, by besmearing the body with potter's clay, by a scanty diet, and that taken once a day in the case of one accustomed to two meals, by drinking little and that only after the consumption of whatever food is to be taken, also by rest after food. On the contrary they are rendered loose: by increasing the length of the walk, more food and drink; by moving about after the meal; by frequently drinking during the meal. This too should be recognized, that a vomit confines the bowels when relaxed, and relaxes them when costive: again, a vomit immediately after the meal confines the bowels, later it relaxes them. As to what pertains to age: the middle-aged sustain hunger more easily, less so young people, and least of all children and old people. The less readily one supports it, the more often should food be taken; one who is growing needs it most. Children and the old should bathe in warm water. Wine should be diluted for children; for the old men it should be rather undilute: but at neither age be of a kind to cause flatulence. It matters less for the young what they take and the way they are treated. Those who [p. 67] when young are relaxed, when old are generally costive; those constipated in youth are often relaxed when old. It is better to be rather relaxed when young, rather costive when old. The season of the year also merits consideration. In winter it is fitting to eat more, and to drink less but of a stronger wine, to use much bread, meat preferably boiled, vegetables sparingly; to take a single meal unless the bowels are too costive. If a meal is taken at midday, it is better that it should be somewhat scanty, and that dry, without meat, and without drinking. At that season everything taken should be hot or heat-promoting. Venery then is not so pernicious. But in spring food should be reduced a little, the drink added to, but, however, of wine more diluted; more meat along with vegetables should be taken, passing gradually from boiled to roast. Venery is safest at this season of the year. But in summer the body requires both food and drink oftener, and so it is proper in addition to take a meal at midday. At that season both meat and vegetables are most appropriate; wine that is much diluted in order that thirst may be relieved without heating the body; laving with cold water, roasted meat, cold food or food which is cooling. But just as food is taken more frequently, so there should be less of it. In autumn owing to changes in the weather there is most danger. Hence it is not good to go out of doors unless well covered, and with thick shoes, especially on the colder days; nor at night to sleep in the open air, or at any rate to be well covered. A little more food may now be taken, the wine less in quantity but stronger. Some think orchard fruit injurious, which is generally the [p. 69] case when eaten immoderately all day, without reducing more substantial food. Hence it is not the fruit but the heaping of all things together which does harm, but in none of them all is there less harm than in the fruit. But it is not fitting to eat of it oftener than other kinds of food, and when eaten, it is necessary to subtract some of the more substantial food. But venery is useful neither in summer nor in autumn; it is more tolerable nevertheless in autumn, in summer it is to be abstained from entirely, if that possibly be done.",,"3   Now the foregoing precepts indeed almost always hold good; but some particular notice requires to be taken of changes of surroundings and varieties of constitution and sex and age and seasons. For it is not safe to remove either from a salubrious to an oppressive locality, or from an oppressive to a salubrious one. It is better to make the move from a salubrious into an oppressive place at the beginning of winter, from an oppressive into a salubrious one in early summer. It is not good indeed to overeat after a long fast, nor to fast after overeating. And he runs a risk who goes contrary to his habit and eats immoderately whether once or twice in the day. Again, neither sudden idleness after excessive labour, nor sudden labour after excessive idleness, is without serious harm. Therefore when a man wishes to make a change, he ought to habituate himself little by little; indeed any work is easier even for a boy or an old man than for an unaccustomed adult. Hence also too idle a life is inexpedient, because there may come up some necessity for labour. But if at any time a man has had to undergo unaccustomed labour, or at any rate much more than he is used to, he should go to bed on an empty stomach, more especially if he has a bitter taste in his mouth, or his eyes are dimmed, or his bowels disturbed; for then he must not only sleep with his stomach empty, but even remain at rest over the next day, unless rest has quickly removed the trouble; in this case,[p. 53],he should get up and take slowly a short walk. But even when there has been no necessity for a sleep, because a man has only done more moderate work, still he ought, all the same, to take a little walk. This then should be the rule for everyone after incurring fatigue before taking food: first to walk about a little, then, if no bath is at hand, to undergo anointing and sweating in a warm place whether in the sun or before a fire; when there is a bath, he should first sit in the warm room, then, after resting there a while, go down into the tubs; next, after being anointed freely with oil and gently rubbed down, again descend into the tub; finally he should foment the face, first with warm, then with cold water. A very hot bath does not suit such cases. Therefore if one's excessive fatigue almost amounts to a fever, it is quite sufficient for him to sit in warm water, to which a little oil may be added, up to the groins, in a tepid room; next his whole body, and especially the parts which have been under water, should be rubbed gently with oil to which a little wine and pounded salt have been added. This done, anybody who has undergone fatigue is ready for food, in particular food of a fluid consistency; he should be content with water to drink, or if wine, certainly diluted, of the sort to promote diuresis. Further it should be recognized that after labour accompanied by sweating a cold drink is most pernicious, and even although sweating after a fatiguing journey has passed off, it is unserviceable. After coming out of the bath, too, Asclepiades held it unserviceable; and this is true in the case of those whose bowels are loose at uncertain moments, and who readily shiver; but it is not the universal rule,[p. 55],in all cases, since it is more natural that a heated stomach should be cooled, and a cold one warmed by a drink. I grant so much, but I hesitate to give this as a rule, for as a matter of fact a cold drink is bad while sweating. It also happens that after a dinner of many courses and many drinks of diluted wine a vomit is even advantageous; the next day there should be a prolonged rest followed by exercise in moderation. If there is oppression due to a persistence of fatigue, water and wine should be drunk alternately, but the bath seldom used. A change of work, too, relieves lassitude; and when a novel form of customary work has tired a man, that form to which he is accustomed restores him. To one who is fatigued that couch is best which he uses every day; for whether soft or hard, one to which he is unaccustomed wearies him. Certain things are specially applicable to one who is fatigued whilst travelling on foot. To be rubbed often while actually on the way restores him; after the journey he should sit awhile, then undergo anointing; next at the bath foment with hot water his upper rather than his lower parts. But anyone who has become overheated in the sun should go at once to the bath, and there have oil poured over the head and body; next go down to a thoroughly hot tub; then have water poured over his head freely, first hot, next cold. On the other hand, he who has become much chilled should first sit in the calidarium, well wrapped up, until he sweats; next be anointed, afterwards laved, then take food in moderation and after that drinks of undiluted wine. He too who on a voyage is troubled by seasickness, if he has vomited out a quantity of bile, should fast or take very little food. If he has spewed,[p. 57],out sour phlegm, he may take food notwithstanding, but lighter than usual; if he has nausea without vomiting, he should either fast, or after food excite a vomit. But he who has spent all day sitting in a carriage or at the games should not after that hurry but walk slowly; also it is of service to linger somewhat in the bath, and then take a small dinner afterwards. When overheated in the bath, taking vinegar and holding it in the mouth restores him; if that is not at hand, cold water may be taken in the same way.,But above all things everyone should be acquainted with the nature of his own body, for some are spare, others obese; some hot, others more frigid; some moist, others dry; some are costive, in others the bowels are loose. It is seldom but that a man has some part of his body weak. So then a thin man ought to fatten himself up, a stout one to thin himself down; a hot man to cool himself, a cold man to make himself warmer; the moist to dry himself up, the dry to moisten himself; he should render firmer his motions if loose, relax them if costive; treatment is to be always directed to the part which is mostly in trouble.,Now the body is fattened: by moderate exercise, by oftener resting, by anointing, and by the bath if after a meal at midday; by the bowels being confined, by winter cold in moderation, by sleep adequate but not over long, by a soft couch, by a tranquil spirit, by food whether solid or fluid which is sweet and fatty; by meals rather frequent and as large as it is possible to digest. The body is thinned: by hot water if one bathes in it and especially if salt; by the bath on an empty stomach, by a scorching sun, by heat of all kinds, by worry, by late nights;  by sleep unduly short or overlong, by a hard bed throughout the summer; by running or much walking or any violent exercise; by a vomit, by purgation, by sour and harsh things consumed; by a single meal a day; by the custom of drinking wine not too cold upon an empty stomach.,But as I have mentioned a vomit and a purge among thinning measures, there are some things to be said in particular concerning them. I note that a vomit was rejected by Asclepiades in the book written by him, entitled De tuenda sanitate; I do not blame him for being disquieted with the custom of those, who by ejecting every day achieve a capacity for gormandizing. He has even gone somewhat further; for from the same volume he has expelled likewise purgings; which indeed are pernicious when procured by too powerful medicaments. Such measures, however, are not to be dispensed with entirely, because regard for different constitutions and times can make them necessary, provided that they are employed in moderation and only when needed. Hence Asclepiades has himself allowed that what is already corrupted ought to be expelled: so this kind of treatment is not wholly to be condemned. But there may be more than one reason for this too; and so a somewhat closer consideration may be given to the matter.,A vomit is more advantageous in winter than in summer, for then more phlegm and severer stuffiness in the head occur. It is unsuitable for the thin and for those with a weak stomach, but suitable for the plethoric, and all who have become bilious, whether after overeating or imperfect digestion. For if the meal has been larger than can be digested, it is not,[p. 61],well to risk its corruption; and if it has already become corrupted, nothing is more to the purpose than to eject it by whatever way its expulsion is first possible. When, therefore, there are bitter eructations, with pain and weight over the heart, recourse should be had at once to a vomit, which is likewise of service to anyone who has heartburn and copious salivation or nausea, or ringing in the ears, or watering of the eyes, or a bitter taste in the mouth; similarly in the case of one who is making a change of climate or locality; as well as in the case of those who become troubled by pain over the heart when they have not vomited for several days. Nor am I unaware that in such cases there is prescribed rest, but that is not always within the reach of those who are obliged to be busy; nor does rest act in the same way with everybody. Accordingly I allow that vomiting should not be practised for the sake of luxury; on account of health I believe from experiment that it is sometimes rightly practised, nevertheless with this reservation, that no one who wants to keep well, and live to old age, should make it a daily habit. He who after a meal wants to vomit, if he does so easily should first take tepid water by itself; when there is more difficulty, a little salt or honey should be added. To cause a vomit on getting up in the morning, he should first drink some honey or hyssop in wine, or eat a radish, and after that drink tepid water as described above. The other emetics prescribed by the ancient practitioners all disturb the stomach. After a vomit, when the stomach is weak, a little suitable food should be taken, and for drink, unless the vomiting has made the throat raw, three cupfuls of cold water. He who has provoked,[p. 63],a vomit, if it be early in the day, should after that take a walk, next undergo anointing, then dine; if after dining, he should the next day bathe, or sweat in the baths. After that the following meal had better be a light one, consisting of bread a day old, harsh undiluted wine, roasted meat, all food being of the dryest. Whoever aims to provoke a vomit twice a month, had better arrange to do so on two consecutive days, rather than once a fortnight, unless this longer interval causes heaviness in the chest.,Now defaecation is to be procured also by a medicament, when, the bowels being costive, too little is passed, with the result that there is increase of flatulence, dizziness of vision, headaches, and other disturbances in the upper parts. For what can rest and fasting help in such circumstances which come about so much through them? He who wants to defaecate should in the first place make use of such food and wine as will promote it; then if these have little effect, he should take aloes. But purgatives also, whilst necessary at times, when frequently used entail danger; for the body becomes subject to malnutrition, since a weakened state leaves it exposed to maladies of all sorts.,The body is heated: by anointing, by salt-water affusion and the more so when hot; by all food which is salt, bitter and fleshy; and after meals by the bath and harsh wine. On the contrary it is cooled: by the bath and sleep on an empty stomach, if not too prolonged; by all sour food; by the coldest water to drink, by oil affusion when mixed with water.,The body is rendered humid: by more than customary exertion, by a frequent bath, by food in,[p. 65],increased amount, by copious drinking, followed by walking and late hours; much walking, early and forced, has by itself the same effect, food being taken not immediately after exercise; so also those classes of edibles which come from cold and rainy and irrigated localities. On the contrary the body is dried: by moderate exercise, hunger, anointing without the addition of water, summer heat with moderate exposure to the sun, cold water to drink, food immediately after exercise, and all edibles coming from hot and dry districts.,The bowels are confined by exertion, by sitting still, by besmearing the body with potter's clay, by a scanty diet, and that taken once a day in the case of one accustomed to two meals, by drinking little and that only after the consumption of whatever food is to be taken, also by rest after food. On the contrary they are rendered loose: by increasing the length of the walk, more food and drink; by moving about after the meal; by frequently drinking during the meal. This too should be recognized, that a vomit confines the bowels when relaxed, and relaxes them when costive: again, a vomit immediately after the meal confines the bowels, later it relaxes them.,As to what pertains to age: the middle-aged sustain hunger more easily, less so young people, and least of all children and old people. The less readily one supports it, the more often should food be taken; one who is growing needs it most. Children and the old should bathe in warm water. Wine should be diluted for children; for the old men it should be rather undilute: but at neither age be of a kind to cause flatulence. It matters less for the young what they take and the way they are treated. Those who,[p. 67],when young are relaxed, when old are generally costive; those constipated in youth are often relaxed when old. It is better to be rather relaxed when young, rather costive when old.,The season of the year also merits consideration. In winter it is fitting to eat more, and to drink less but of a stronger wine, to use much bread, meat preferably boiled, vegetables sparingly; to take a single meal unless the bowels are too costive. If a meal is taken at midday, it is better that it should be somewhat scanty, and that dry, without meat, and without drinking. At that season everything taken should be hot or heat-promoting.

But in spring food should be reduced a little, the drink added to, but, however, of wine more diluted; more meat along with vegetables should be taken, passing gradually from boiled to roast.

My present delight is to pick up anything particularly suitable to a gymnasium. Lentulus promises the use of his ships. I beg you to be zealous in these matters. Thyillus begs you (and I also at his request) to get him some writings of the Eumolpidae. 1 V (A I, 8) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME All well at your house. Your mother and sister are regarded with affection by me and my brother Quintus. I have spoken to Acutilius. He says that he has not heard from his agent, and professes surprise that you should make any difficulty of his having refused to guarantee you against farther demands. As to the business of Tadius, the announcement in your letter that you have settled the matter Out of court I saw gratified and pleased him very much. That friend of mine 2 —a most excellent man, upon my honour, and most warmly attached to me—is very angry with you. If I could but know how much you care about it, I should be able to decide how much trouble I am to take in the matter. I have paid L. Cincius the 20,400 sesterces written for the Megaric statues in accordance with your letter to me. As to your Hermae of Pentelic marble with bronze heads, about which you wrote to me—I have fallen in love with them on the spot. So pray send both them and the statues, and anything else that may appear to you to suit the place you know of, my passion, and your taste—as large a supply and as early as possible. Above all, anything you think appropriate to a gymnasium and terrace. I have such a passion for things of this sort that while I expect assistance from you, I must expect something like rebuke from others. If Lentulus has no vessel there, put them on board anyone you please. My pet Tulliola claims your present and duns me as your security. I am resolved, however, to disown the obligation rather than pay up for you. VI (A I, 10) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) TUSCULUM Being in my Tusculan villa (that's for your being in the Ceramicus )—however, I being there, a courier sent by your sister arrived from Rome and delivered me a letter from you, announcing at the same time that the courier who was going to you started that very afternoon. The result is that, though I do send an answer, I am forced by the shortness of the time to write only these few words. First, as to softening my friend's feeling towards you, or even reconciling him outright, I pledge you my word to do so. Though I have been attempting it already on my own account, I will now urge the point more earnestly and press him closer, as I think I gather from your letter that you are so set upon it. This much I should like you to realize, that he is very deeply offended; but since I cannot see any serious ground for it, I feel confident that he will do as I wish and yield to my influence. As for my statues and Hermeracles, pray put them on board, as you say in your letter, at your very earliest convenience, and anything else you light upon that may seem to you appropriate to the place you know of, especially anything you think suitable to a palaestra and gymnasium. I say this because I am sitting there as I write. so that the very place itself reminds me. Besides these, I commission you to get me some medallions to let into the walls of my little entrance-court, and two engraved stone-curbs. Mind you don't engage your library to anyone, however keen a lover you may find; for I am hoarding up my little savings expressly to secure that resource for my old age. As to my brother, I trust that all is as I have ever wished and tried to make it. There are many signs of that result—not least that your sister is enceinte. As for my election, I don't forget that I left the question entirely to you, and I have all along been telling our common friends that I have not only not asked you to come, but have positively forbidden you to do so, because I understood that it was much more important to you to carry through the business you have now in hand, than it is to me to have you at my election. I wish you therefore to feel as though you had been sent to where you are in my interests. Nay, you will find me feeling towards you, and hear of it from others, exactly as though my success were obtained not only in your presence, but by your direct agency. Tulliola gives notice of action against you. She is dunning me as your surety. VII (A I, 11) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME I was doing so before spontaneously, and have been since greatly stirred by your two letters, with their earnest expressions to the same effect. Besides, Sallustius has been always at my side to prompt me to spare no pains to induce Lucceius to be reconciled to you. But after doing everything that could be done, not only did I fail to renew his old feelings towards you, but I could not even succeed in eliciting the reason of his alienation. On his part, however, he keeps harping on that arbitration case of his, and the other matters which I knew very well before you left Rome were causing him offence. Still, he has certainly got something else fixed deeper in his mind; and this no letters from you, and no commissioning of me will obliterate as easily as you will do in a personal interview, I don't mean merely by your words, but by the old familiar expression of your face—if only you think it worth while, as you will if you will listen to me, and be willing to act with your habitual kindness. Finally, you need not wonder why it is that, whereas I intimated in my letters that I felt hopeful of his yielding to my influence, I now appear to have no such confidence; for you can scarcely believe how much more stubborn his sentiment appears to me than I expected, and how much more obstinate he is in this anger. However, all this will either be cured when you come, or will only be painful to the party in fault. As to the sentence in your letter, you suppose by this time I am praetor-elect, let me tell you that there is no class of people at Rome so harassed by every kind of unreasonable difficulty as candidates for office; and that no one knows when the elections will be. 3 However, you will hear all this from Philadelphus. Pray despatch at the earliest opportunity what you have bought for my Academia. I am surprisingly delighted with the mere thought of that place, to say nothing of its actual occupation. Mind also not to let anyone else have your books. Reserve them, as you say in your letter, for me. I am possessed with the utmost longing for them, as I am with a loathing for affairs of every other kind, which you will find in an incredibly worse position than when you left them. 4","Note: 1 Thyillus                                                   (sometimes Chilius), a Greek poet living at Rome .

                                                  confidence; for you can scarcely believe how much

Celsus,De Medicina,"Book I, chapter 4","4 I have next to speak of those who have some parts of the body weak. He whose head is infirm ought, after he has digested well, to rub it gently in the morning with his own hands; never if possible cover it with a wrap; have it shaved to the skin. It is well to avoid moonlight, and especially before the actual conjunction of the moon and sun, and to walk nowhere after dinner. If he has retained his hair, he should comb it every day, walk much, but, if possible, not under cover nor in the sun; everywhere, however, he should avoid the sun's blaze, especially after taking food and wine; undergo anointing rather than affusion, but that never before a flaming fire, on occasion before a brazier. If he goes owing to the bath he should first sweat for a while, in the tepidarium, wrapped up, and then undergo anointing there; next pass into the calidarium; after a further sweat he should not go down into the hot bath, but have himself sluiced freely from the head downwards, first with hot, next with tepid, then with cold water, which should be poured for longer on the head than upon other parts, after which it should be rubbed for a while, lastly wiped dry and anointed. Nothing is so [p. 71] beneficial to the head as cold water, and so he who has a weak head every day throughout the summer hold it for a while under the stream from a large conduit. But even if he undergoes anointing without going into the bath, and cannot bear cooling of the whole body, he should always nevertheless douche his head with cold water; but since he does not want the rest of his body wetted, he bends forward for the water not to run down his neck, and with his hands directs the flow to his face, that his eyes or other parts may not be irritated.

It is more expedient for him to drink a light wine, well diluted, rather than water, in order that he may have something in reserve when his head begins to become heavier; and to him, on the whole, neither wine nor water is proper always; each constitutes a remedy when taken in its turn. To write, to read, to argue, is not beneficial to him, particularly after dinner; after which, indeed, even cogitation is not sufficiently safe; worst of all, however, is a vomit.",,"4   I have next to speak of those who have some parts of the body weak. He whose head is infirm ought, after he has digested well, to rub it gently in the morning with his own hands; never if possible cover it with a wrap; have it shaved to the skin. It is well to avoid moonlight, and especially before the actual conjunction of the moon and sun, and to walk nowhere after dinner. If he has retained his hair, he should comb it every day, walk much, but, if possible, not under cover nor in the sun; everywhere, however, he should avoid the sun's blaze, especially after taking food and wine; undergo anointing rather than affusion, but that never before a flaming fire, on occasion before a brazier. If he goes owing to the bath he should first sweat for a while, in the tepidarium, wrapped up, and then undergo anointing there; next pass into the calidarium; after a further sweat he should not go down into the hot bath, but have himself sluiced freely from the head downwards, first with hot, next with tepid, then with cold water, which should be poured for longer on the head than upon other parts, after which it should be rubbed for a while, lastly wiped dry and anointed. Nothing is so,[p. 71],beneficial to the head as cold water, and so he who has a weak head every day throughout the summer hold it for a while under the stream from a large conduit. But even if he undergoes anointing without going into the bath, and cannot bear cooling of the whole body, he should always nevertheless douche his head with cold water; but since he does not want the rest of his body wetted, he bends forward for the water not to run down his neck, and with his hands directs the flow to his face, that his eyes or other parts may not be irritated. He must take food in moderation and such as he can easily digest; and if fasting affects his head, he should take a meal at midday; if it does not so suffer, the single meal is preferable. It is more expedient for him to drink a light wine, well diluted, rather than water, in order that he may have something in reserve when his head begins to become heavier; and to him, on the whole, neither wine nor water is proper always; each constitutes a remedy when taken in its turn.

M. Tullius Cicero,Letters,,"B.C. 66. Coss., M. Aemilius Lepidus, L. Volcacius Tullus. B.C. 66. Coss., M. Aemilius Lepidus, L. Volcacius Tullus. In this year Cicero was praetor, and delivered his first extant public speech ( apud populum ) in support of the lex Manilia , which gave Pompey the command in the Mithridatic War with the provinces of Asia and Bithynia . The strict Optimates opposed it. Cicero supported it on the grounds of the importance of the war and the proofs Pompey had already given of military ability, courage, personal prestige, and good fortune. He takes occasion to point out the mischief done to the Roman name by oppressive or fraudulent governors and imperators. In this same year he delivered one of his ablest speeches in court in defending A. Cluentius Habitus on a charge of poisoning. At the consular elections this year the two first elected were disabled for bribery. VIII (A I, 3) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME , JANUARY I have to inform you of the death of your grandmother from pining at your long absence, and at the same time because she was afraid that the Latin towns would revolt and fail to bring the victims up the Alban Mount. I presume that L. Saufeius will send you a letter of condolence on the subject. 1 I am expecting you here in the course of January—is it a mere rumour or does it come from letters of yours to others? For to me you have not mentioned the subject. The statues which you got for me have been landed at Caieta . I haven't seen them, for I have been unable to leave Rome . I have sent a man to clear the freightage. I am exceedingly obliged to you for having taken so much trouble to get them, and so reasonably. As to your frequent remarks in your letters about pacifying my friend, I have done everything I could and tried every expedient; but he is inveterate against you to a surprising degree, on what suspicions though I think you have been told, you shall yet learn from me when you come. I failed to restore Sallustius 2 to his old place in his affections, and yet he was on the spot I tell you this because the latter used to find fault with me in regard to you Well, he has found by personal experience that he is not so easy to pacify, and that on my part no zeal has been lacking either on his or your behalf. I have betrothed Tulliola to C. Piso Frugi, son of Lucius. 3 IX (A I, 4) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME You keep on making me expect you again and again. Only the other day, when I thought you on the point of arriving, I was suddenly put off by you till Quintilis (July). Now, however, I do think that you should Come at the time you mention if you possibly can. You will thereby be in time for my brother Quintus's election, will pay me long-deferred visit, and will settle the dispute with Acutilius. This latter Peducaeus also suggested my mentioning to you, for I think it is full time that you settled that affair. My good offices are at your service and always have been so. Here at Rome I have conducted the case of Gaius Macer with a popular approval surpassing belief and unparalleled. Though I had been inclined to take a lenient view of his case, yet I gained much more substantial advantage from the popular approval on his condemnation than I should have got from his gratitude if he had been acquitted. 4 I am very glad to hear what you say about the Hermathena. It is an ornament appropriate to my Academia for two reasons: Hermes is a sign Common to all gymnasia, Minerva specially of this particular one. So I would have you, as you say, adorn the place with the other objects also, and the more the better. The statues which you sent me before I have not yet seen. They are in my villa at Formiae , whither I am at this moment thinking of going. I shall get them all transferred to my Tusculan villa. If I find myself with more than I want there I shall begin adorning Caieta . Please reserve your books, and don't despair of my being able to make them mine. If I succeed in that, I am superior to Crassus in wealth and look down on everybody's manors and pastures. 5","Note: 1 The point                                                   of this frigid joke is not clear.

                    Now I will briefly set before you; also, my intention in returning, which may
                    perhaps appear more unaccountable. As I had avoided,Brundusium,, and the ordinary route into,Greece,, not without good reason, on
                    the first of August I arrived at,Syracuse,, because the passage from that city into,Greece,was said to be a good one. And that
                    city, with which I had so intimate a connection, could not, though it was very
                    eager to do so, detain me more than one night. I was afraid that my sudden

Manlius Torquatus. The election to the Consulship is not till the next year (B.C. 64), but Cicero is already making preparation for it, and looking out for support. In July his only son was born. He does not refer to the so-called first Catilinarian conspiracy, but mentions Catiline as a possible competitor, and even contemplates defending him on some charge brought against him to prevent his standing for the consulship. X (A I, 1) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME , JULY The state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I know that you are supremely interested, is this, as far as can be as yet conjectured. The only person actually canvassing is P. Sulpicius Galba. 1 He meets with a good old-fashioned refusal without reserve or disguise. In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not unfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally give as a reason for their refusal that they are under obligations to me. So I hope my prospects are to a certain degree improved by the report getting about that my friends are found to be numerous. My intention was to begin my own canvass just at the very time that Cincius 2 tells me that your servant starts with this letter, namely, in the campus at the time of the tribunician elections on the 17th of July. My fellow candidates, to mention only those who seem certain, are Galba and Antonius and Q. Cornificius. 3 At this I imagine you smiling or sighing. Well, to make you positively smite your forehead, there are people who actually think that Caesonius 4 will stand. I don't think Aquilius will, for he openly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his leading position at the bar. Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if you can imagine a jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon. As for Aufidius and Palicanus, 5 I don't think you will expect to hear from me about them. Of the candidates for this year's election Caesar is considered certain. Thermus is looked upon as the rival of Silanus . 6 These latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems pas impossible to bring in Curius over their heads. But no one else thinks so. What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should get in with Caesar. For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if left over to my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the fact that he is Commissioner of the via Flaminia , and when that has been finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected consul this election. 7 Such in outline is the position of affairs in regard to candidates up to date. For myself I shall take the greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul seems to have a considerable voting power, as soon as business at Rome has come to a standstill I shall obtain a libera legatio and make an excursion in the courseof September to visit Piso, 8 but so as not to be back later than January. When I have ascertained the feelings of the nobility I will write you word. Everything else I hope will go smoothly, at any rate while my competitors are such as are now in town. You must undertake to secure for me the entourage of our friend Pompey, since you are nearer than I. Tell him I shall not be annoyed if he doesn't come to my election. 9 So much for that business. But there is a matter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive me. Your uncle Caecilius having been defrauded of a large sum of money by P. Varius, began an action against his cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the property which (as he alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a collusive sale. He was joined in this action by the other creditors, among whom were Lucullus and P. Scipio, and the man whom they thought would be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius Pontius; though it is ridiculous to be talking about a receiver at this stage in the proceedings. Caecilius asked me to appear for him against satyrus. Now, scarcely a day passes that Satyrus does not call at my house. The chief object of his attentions is L Domitius, 10 but I am next in his regard. He has been of great service both to myself and to my brother Quintus in our elections. I was very much embarrassed by my intimacy with Satyrus as well as that with Domitius, on whom the success of my election depends more than on anyone else. I pointed out these facts to Caecilius; at the same time I assured him that if the case had been one exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I would have done what he wished. As the matter actually stood, all the creditors being concerned—and that too men of the highest rank, who without the aid of anyone specially retained by Caecilius, would have no difficulty in maintaining their common cause—it was only fair that he should have consideration both for my private friendship and my present situation. He seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than I could have wished or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that time forth 'he has entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me, which was only of a few day's standing. 11 Pray forgive me, and believe that I was prevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the reputation of a friend in so vital a point at a time of such very great distress, considering that he had shown me every sort of kindness and attention. But if you incline to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that the interests of my canvass prevented me. Yet, even granting that to be so, I think you should pardon me, since not for sacred beast or oxhide shield. 12 You see in fact the position I am in and how necessary I regard it, not only to retain but even 'to acquire all possible sources of popularity. I hope I have justified myself in your eyes, I am at any rate anxious to have done so. The Hermathena you sent I am delighted with: it has been placed with such Charming effect that the whole gymnasium seems arranged speclally for it. 13 I am exceedingly obliged to you. XI (A I, 2) TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS) ROME , JULY I have to inform you that on the day of the election of L. Iulius Caesar and C. Marcius Figulus to the Consulship, I had an addition to my family in the shape of a baby boy. Terentia doing well. Why such a time without a letter from you? I have already written to you fully about my circumstances. At this present time I am considering whether to undertake the defence of my fellow candidate, Catiline. 14 We have a jury to our minds with full consent of the prosecutor. I hope that if he is acquitted he will be more closely united with me in the conduct of our canvass; but if the result be otherwise I shall bear it with resignation. Your early return is of great importance to me, for there is a very strong idea prevailing that some intimate friends of yours, persons of high rank, will be opposed to my election. To win me their favour I see that I shall want you very much. Wherefore be sure to be in Rome in January, as you have agreed to be.","Note: 1 One of the judices rejected by Verres on his trial, a                                                   pontifex and augur.,Note: 2 Agent of Atticus ,Note: 3 C.

                                                  candidates, to mention only those who seem
                                                  certain, are Galba and Antonius and Q.

                                                  Well, to make you positively smite your forehead,
                                                  there are people who actually think that Caesonius,insert_note_48,4,will stand. I don't think Aquilius will,
                                                  for he openly disclaims it and has alleged as an
                                                  excuse his health and his leading position at the
                                                  bar. Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if
                                                  you can imagine a jury finding that the sun does
                                                  not shine at noon. As for Aufidius and Palicanus,,insert_note_52,5,I don't
                                                  think you will expect to hear from me about them.
                                                  Of the candidates for this year's election Caesar
                                                  is considered certain. Thermus is looked upon as
                                                  the rival of,Silanus,.,insert_note_60,6,These latter are so weak both in friends
                                                  and reputation that it seems pas impossible to bring in Curius over
                                                  their heads. But no one else thinks so. What seems
                                                  most to my interests is that Thermus should get
                                                   in with Caesar. For there is none of
                                                  those at present canvassing who, if left over to
                                                  my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate,
                                                  from the fact that he is Commissioner of the,via,,Flaminia,, and
                                                  when that has been finished, I shall be greatly
                                                  relieved to have seen him elected consul this
                                                  election.,insert_note_71,7,Such in
                                                  outline is the position of affairs in regard to
                                                  candidates up to date. For myself I shall take the
                                                  greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a
                                                  candidate, and perhaps, as,Gaul,seems to have a
                                                  considerable voting power, as soon as business at,Rome,has

                                                  excursion in the courseof September to visit Piso,,insert_note_90,8,but so as not to be back later than
                                                  January. When I have ascertained the feelings of
                                                  the nobility I will write you word. Everything
                                                  else I hope will go smoothly, at any rate while my
                                                  competitors are such as are now in town. You must
                                                  undertake to secure for me the entourage of our
                                                  friend Pompey, since you are nearer than I. Tell

                                                  matter for which I am very anxious that you should
                                                  forgive me. Your uncle Caecilius having been
                                                  defrauded of a large sum of money by P. Varius,
                                                  began an action against his cousin A. Caninius
                                                  Satyrus for the property which (as he alleged) the
                                                  latter had received from Varius by a collusive
                                                  sale. He was joined in this action by the other
                                                  creditors, among whom were,Lucullus,and P.
                                                  Scipio, and the man whom they thought would be
                                                  official receiver if the property was put up for
                                                  sale, Lucius Pontius; though it is ridiculous to
                                                  be talking about  a receiver at this
                                                  stage in the proceedings. Caecilius asked me to
                                                  appear for him against satyrus. Now, scarcely a
                                                  day passes that Satyrus does not call at my house.
                                                  The chief object of his attentions is L Domitius,,insert_note_101,10,but I am next in his regard. He
                                                  has been of great service both to myself and to my
                                                  brother Quintus in our elections. I was very much
                                                  embarrassed by my intimacy with Satyrus as well as
                                                  that with Domitius, on whom the success of my
                                                  election depends more than on anyone else. I
                                                  pointed out these facts to Caecilius; at the same
                                                  time I assured him that if the case had been one
                                                  exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I would
                                                  have done what he wished. As the matter actually
                                                  stood, all the creditors being
                                                  concerned—and that too men of the
                                                  highest rank, who without the aid of anyone
                                                  specially retained by Caecilius, would have no
                                                  difficulty in maintaining their common
                                                  cause—it was only fair that he should
                                                  have consideration both for my private friendship
                                                  and my present situation. He seemed to take this
                                                  somewhat less courteously than I could have wished
                                                  or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that
                                                  time forth 'he has entirely withdrawn from the
                                                  intimacy with me, which was only of a few day's
                                                  standing.,insert_note_105,11,Pray forgive me, and believe
                                                  that I was prevented by nothing but natural
                                                  kindness from assailing the reputation of a friend
                                                  in so vital a point at a time of such very great
                                                  distress, considering that he had shown me every
                                                  sort of kindness and attention. But if you incline
                                                  to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that
                                                  the interests of my canvass prevented me. Yet,
                                                  even granting that to be so, I think you should

M. Tullius Cicero,Letters,Volume 1,"B.C. 62. Coss., D. Iunius Silanus, L. Licinius Murena. B.C. 62. Coss., D. Iunius Silanus, L. Licinius Murena. We have no letters to or from Cicero in the years B.C. 64 and 63, 1 partly, no doubt, because Atticus was in Rome a great deal during these years. We take up the correspondence, therefore, after an interval of two years, which in many respects were the most important in Cicero 's life. In B.C. 64 he attained his chief ambition by being elected to the consulship, but we have little trace of his public actions that year, only the fragments of one speech remaining, in defence of Q. Gallius on a charge of ambitus . The animus of the popular party, however, is shown by the prosecution of some surviving partisans of Sulla on charges of homicide, among them Catiline, who by some means escaped conviction ( Dio, 37.10 ). In the year of the consulship (B.C. 63) some of Cicero 's most important speeches were delivered. The three on the agrarian proposals of Rullus present him to us for the first time as discussing an important question of home politics, the disposal of the ager publicus a question which had become again prominent owing to the great additions made to it by the confiscations of Sulla. He also defended C. Rabirius, prosecuted by Iulius Caesar for the murder of Saturninus as long ago as B.C. 100, and later in the year defended Murena on a charge of ambitus . Finally, the three Catilinarian speeches illustrate the event which coloured the whole of Cicero 's life. In B.C. 62 his brother Quintus was praetor and Cicero defended in his court P. Sulla, accused of complicity with Catiline. On the 29th of December (B.C. 63) the tribune Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos prevented Cicero from making a speech when laying down his consulship, and went on to propose summoning Pompey to Rome , to protect the lives of the citizens. This led to scenes of violence, and Metellus fled to Pompey, who reached Italy late in the year B.C. 62 from the East. XII (F V, 7) TO CN. POMPEIUS MAGNUS ROME M. Tullius Cicero, son of Marcus, greets Cn. Pompeius, son of Cneius, Imperator. If you and the army are well I shall be glad. From your official despatch I have, in common with everyone else, received the liveliest satisfaction; for you have given us that strong hope of peace, of which, in sole reliance on you, I was assuring everyone. But I must inform you that your old enemies—now posing as your friends—have received a stunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in the high hopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly depressed. Though your private letter to me contained a somewhat slight expression of your affection, yet I can assure you it gave me pleasure: for there is nothing in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in the consciousness of serving my friends; and if on any occasion I do not meet with an adequate return, I am not at all sorry to have the balance of kindness in my favour. Of this I feel no doubt—even if my extraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to unite you to me—that the interests of the state will certainly effect a mutual attachment and coalition between us. To let you know, however, what I missed in your letter I will write with the candour which my own disposition and our common friendship demand. I did expect some congratulation in your letter on my achievements, for the sake at once of the ties between us and of the Republic. This I presume to have been omitted by you from a fear of hurting anyone's feelings. But let me tell you that what I did for the salvation of the country is approved by the judgment and testimony of the whole world. You are a much greater man than Africanus, but I am not much inferior to Laelius either; and when you come home you will recognize that I have acted with such prudence and spirit, that you will not be ashamed of being coupled with me in politics as well as in private friendship. XIII (F V, 1) Q. METELLUS CELER TO CICERO CISALPINE GAUL Q. Metellus Celer, son of Quintus, proconsul, greets M. Tullius Cicero. 2 If you are well I am glad. I had thought, considering our mutual regard and the reconciliation effected between us, that I was not likely to be held up to ridicule in my absence, nor my brother attacked by you in his civil existence and property for the sake of a mere word. If his own high character was not a sufficient protection to him, yet either the position of our family, or my own loyal conduct to you and the Republic ought to have been sufficient to support him. As it is I see that he has been ruined and I abandoned by the last people in the world who ought to have done so. I am accordingly in sorrow and wearing mourning dress, while actually in command of a province and army and conducting a war. And seeing that your conduct in this affair has neither been reasonable nor in accordance with the milder methods of old times, you must not be surprised if you live to repent it. I did not expect to find you so fickle towards me and mine. For myself, meanwhile, neither family sorrow nor ill-treatment by any individual shall withdraw me from the service of the state. XIV (F V, 2) TO Q. METELLUS (IN CISALPINE GAUL) ROME M. Tullius, son of Marcus, to Q. Metellus Celer, son of Quintus, proconsul wishes health. If you and the army are well I shall be glad. You say in your letter that you thought, considering our mutual regard and the reconciliation effected between us, that you were not likely to be held up to ridicule by me. To what you refer I do not clearly understand, but I suspect that you have been informed that, while arguing in the senate that there were many who were annoyed at my having saved the state, I said that your relations, whose wishes you had been unable to withstand, had induced you to pass over in silence what you had made up your mind you ought to say in the senate in my praise. But while saying so I also added this—that the duty of supporting the Republic had been so divided between us that I was defending the city from internal treachery and the crime of its own citizens, you Italy from armed enemies and covert conspiracy 3 yet that this association in a task so noble and so glorious had been imperilled by your relations, who, while you had been complimented by me in the fullest and most laudatory terms, had been afraid of any display of mutual regard on your part being put to my credit. As this sentence betrayed how much I had looked forward to your speech, and how mistaken I had been in that expectation, my speech caused some amusement, and was received with a moderate amount of laughter; but the laugh was not against you, it was rather at my mistake, and at the open and naive confession of my eagerness to be commended by you. Surely it cannot but be a compliment to you that in the hour of my greatest triumph and glory I yet wished for some testimony of approval from your lips. As to your expression, considering our mutual regard —I don't know your idea of what is mutual in friendship; mine is an equal interchange of good feeling. Now if I were to mention that I passed over a province for your sake, you might think me somewhat insincere; for, in point of fact, it suited my convenience, and I feel more and more every day of my life the advantage and pleasure which I have received from that decision. But this I do say—the moment I had announced in public meeting my refusal of a province, I began at once thinking how I might hand it on to you. I say nothing as to the circumstances of your allotment: I only wish you to suspect that nothing was done in that matter by my colleague without my cognizance. Recall the other circumstances: how promptly I summoned the senate on that day after the lots had been drawn, at what a length I spoke about you. You yourself said at the time that my speech was not merely complimentary to you, but absolutely a reflection on your colleagues. Further, the decree of the senate passed on that day has such a preamble that, so long as it is extant, there can never be any doubt of my services to you. Subsequently, when you had gone out of town; I would have you recall my motions in the senate, my speeches in public meetings, my letters to yourself. And having reviewed all these together, I would like you to judge yourself whether you think that your approach to Rome the last time you came quite showed an adequate return for all these services. 4 Again, as to your expression, the reconciliation effected between us —I do not understand why you speak of reconciliation in the case of a friendship that had never been broken. As to what you say, that your brother Metellus ought not to have been attacked by me for a mere word, in the first place I would like to assure you that your feeling and fraternal partiality—so full of human kindness and natural affection—meet with my warmest approbation; in the next place I must claim your indulgence if I have in any matter opposed your brother in the interests of the Republic, for my devotion to the Republic is paramount. If however, it is my personal safety that I have defended against a most ruthless assault of his, I think you should be content that I make no complaint even to you of your brother's injurious conduct. Now, when I had become aware that he was deliberately making every preparation to use his tribunician office to my ruin, I appealed to your wife Claudia 5 and your sister Mucia 6 (of whose kindness to me for the sake of my friendship with Pompey I had satisfied myself by many instances) to deter him from that injurious conduct. And yet, as I am sure you have heard, on the last day of December he inflicted upon me—a consul and the preserver of my country—an indignity such as was never inflicted upon the most disloyal citizen in the humblest office : that is to say, he deprived me when laying down my office of the privilege of addressing the people—an indignity, however, which after all redounded to my honour. For, upon his forbidding me to do anything but take the oath, I pronounced an oath at once the most absolutely true and the most glorious in a loud voice—an oath which the people swore also in a loud voice to be absolutely true. Though I had actually suffered this signal indignity, I yet on that same day sent common friends to Metellus to persuade him to alter his resolution; to whom he answered that he was no longer free to do so. And, in fact, a short time previously he had said in a public meeting that a man who had punished others without trial ought not himself to be allowed the privilege of speech. What a model of consistency! What an admirable citizen! So he deemed the man who had saved the senate from massacre, the city from the incendiary, Italy from war, deserving of the same penalty as that inflicted by the senate with the unanimous approval of all loyal citizens, upon those who had intended to set fire to the city, butcher magistrates and senate, and stir up a formidable war! Accordingly, I did withstand your brother Metellus to his face: for on the 1st of January, in the senate, I maintained a debate with him on the state of the Republic, such as taught him that he had to contend with a man of courage and firmness. On the 3rd of January, 7 on again opening the debate, he kept harping on me and threatening me at every third word of his speech; nor could any intention be more deliberate than his was to overthrow me by any means in his power, not by calm and judicial argument, but by violence and mere browbeating. If I had not shown some boldness and spirit in opposing his intemperate attack, would not everyone have concluded that the courage I had displayed in my consulship was the result of accident rather than design? If you did not know that Metellus was contemplating these measures in regard to me you must consider that you have been kept in the dark by your brother on matters of the utmost importance: if, on the other hand, he did entrust any part of his designs to you, then surely I ought to be regarded by you as a man of placable and reasonable temper for not addressing a word of reproach to you even on such occurrences as these Understanding then that it was by no mere word (as you express it) of Metellus that I was roused, but by his deliberate policy and extraordinary animosity towards me next observe my forbearance—if forbearance is the name to be given to irresolution and laxity under a most galling indignity. I never once delivered a vote in a speech against your brother every time a motion was before the house I assented without rising to those whose proposal appeared to me to be the mildest. I will also add that, though in the circumstances there was no obligation upon me to do so, yet so far from raising objections I actually did my best to secure that my enemy, because he was your brother, should be relieved from penalties by a decree of the senate. 8 Wherefore I have not attacked your brother, but only defended myself from your brother's attack; nor have I been fickle (to quote your word), but, on the contrary, so constant, that I remained faithful to my friendship to you, though left without any sign of kindness from you. For instance, at this moment, though your letter amounts almost to a threat, I am writing back an answer such as you see. I not only pardon your vexation, I even applaud it in the highest degree; for my own heart tells me how strong is the influence of fraternal affection. I ask you in your turn to put a liberal construction upon my vexation, and to conclude that when attacked by your relatives with bitterness, with brutality, and without cause, I not only ought not to retract anything, but, in a case of that kind, should even be able to rely upon the aid of yourself and your army. I have always wished to have you as a friend: I have taken pains to make you understand that I am a warm friend to you. I abide by that sentiment, and shall abide by it as long as you will let me; and I shall more readily cease to be angry with your brother for love of you, than I shall from anger with him abate in the smallest degree my kindness for you. XV (F V, 6) TO P. SESTIUS (IN MACEDONIA) ROME , DECEMBER 9 Decius the copyist has been to see me, and begged me to try and secure that no successor should be appointed to you this turn. Though I regarded him as a man of good character and attached to you, yet, remembering the tenor of your previous letter to me, I could not feel certain that the wishes of a cautious man of the world like yourself had undergone so complete a change. But after your wife Cornelia had called on Terentia, and I had had a conversation with Q. Cornelius, I took care to be present at every meeting of the senate, and found that the greatest trouble was to make Fufius the tribune, and the others to whom you had written, believe me rather than your own letters. The whole business has, after all, been postponed till January, but there is no difficulty about it. Roused by your congratulations—for in a letter sometime ago you wished me good luck on the completion of my purchase of a house from Crassus—I have bought that very house for 3,500 sestertia, a good while subsequent to your congratulation. Accordingly, you may now look upon me as being so deeply in debt as to be eager to join a conspiracy if anyone would admit me! But, partly from personal dislike they shut their doors in my face and openly denounce me as the punisher of conspiracy, partly are incredulous and afraid that I am setting a trap for them! Nor do they suppose that a man can be short of money who has relieved the money-lenders from a state of siege. In point of fact, money is plentiful at six per cent., and the success of my measures has caused me to be regarded as a good security. Your own house, and all the details of its construction, I have examined and strongly approve. As for Antonius, 10 though everyone notices his want of attention to my interests, I have nevertheless defended him in the senate with the utmost earnestness and persistence, and have made a strong impression on the senate by my language as well as by my personal prestige. Pray write to me more frequently.","Note: 1 The essay on the duties of a candidate attributed                                                   to Quintus is hardly a letter, and there is some                                                   doubt as to its authenticity.

                                                  am not at all sorry to have the balance of
                                                  kindness in my favour. Of this I feel no
                                                  doubt—even if my extraordinary zeal in
                                                  your behalf has failed to unite you to
                                                  me—that the interests of the state will
                                                  certainly effect a mutual attachment and coalition
                                                  between us. To let you know, however, what I
                                                  missed in your letter I will write with the
                                                  candour which my own disposition and our common
                                                  friendship demand. I did expect some
                                                  congratulation in your letter on my achievements,
                                                  for the sake at once of the ties between us and of
                                                  the Republic. This I presume to have been omitted
                                                  by you from a fear of hurting anyone's feelings.

                                                  salvation of the country is approved by the
                                                  judgment and testimony of the whole world. You are
                                                  a much greater man than Africanus, but I am not
                                                  much inferior to Laelius either; and when you come

                                                  acted with such prudence and spirit, that you will

                                                  between us, that I was not likely to be held up to
                                                  ridicule in my absence, nor my brother attacked by

                                                  sake of a mere word. If his own high character was
                                                  not a sufficient protection to him, yet either the
                                                  position of our family, or my own loyal conduct to
                                                  you and the Republic ought to have been sufficient
                                                  to support him. As it is I see that he has been
                                                  ruined and I abandoned by the last people in the

                                                  clearly understand, but I suspect that you have
                                                  been informed that, while arguing in the senate
                                                  that there were many who were annoyed at my having
                                                  saved the state, I said that your relations, whose
                                                  wishes you had been unable to withstand, had
                                                  induced you to pass over in silence what you had
                                                  made up your mind you ought to say in the senate
                                                  in my praise. But while saying so I also added
                                                  this—that the duty of supporting the
                                                  Republic had been so divided between us that I was

                                                  association in a task so noble and so glorious had
                                                  been imperilled by your relations, who, while you
                                                  had been complimented by me in the fullest and
                                                  most laudatory terms, had been afraid of any

                                                  my credit. As this sentence betrayed how much I
                                                  had looked forward to your speech, and how
                                                  mistaken I had  been in that
                                                  expectation, my speech caused some amusement, and
                                                  was received with a moderate amount of laughter;
                                                  but the laugh was not against you, it was rather
                                                  at my mistake, and at the open and naive
                                                  confession of my eagerness to be commended by you.
                                                  Surely it cannot but be a compliment to you that
                                                  in the hour of my greatest triumph and glory I yet

                                                  equal interchange of good feeling. Now if I were
                                                  to mention that I passed over a province for your
                                                  sake, you might think me somewhat insincere; for,
                                                  in point of fact, it suited my convenience, and I

                                                  advantage and pleasure which I have received from
                                                  that decision. But this I do say—the
                                                  moment I had announced in public meeting my
                                                  refusal of a province, I began at once thinking
                                                  how I might hand it on to you. I say nothing as to
                                                  the circumstances of your allotment: I only wish
                                                  you to suspect that nothing was done in that
                                                  matter by my colleague without my cognizance.
                                                  Recall the other circumstances: how promptly I
                                                  summoned the senate on that day after the lots had
                                                  been drawn, at what a length I spoke about you.
                                                  You yourself said at the time that my speech was
                                                  not merely complimentary to you, but absolutely a
                                                  reflection on your colleagues. Further, the decree
                                                  of the senate passed on that day has such a
                                                  preamble that, so long as it is extant, there can

                                                  against a most ruthless assault of his, I think
                                                  you should be content that I make no complaint
                                                  even to you of your brother's injurious conduct.
                                                  Now, when I had become aware that he was
                                                  deliberately making every preparation to use his
                                                  tribunician office to my ruin, I appealed to your
                                                  wife Claudia,insert_note_145,5,and your sister Mucia,insert_note_149,6,(of whose kindness to me
                                                  for the sake of my friendship with Pompey I had
                                                  satisfied myself by many instances) to deter him
                                                  from that injurious conduct. And yet, as I am sure
                                                  you have heard, on the last day of December he
                                                  inflicted upon me—a consul and the
                                                  preserver of my country—an indignity
                                                  such as was never inflicted upon the most disloyal
                                                  citizen in the humblest office : that is to say,
                                                  he deprived me when laying down my office of the
                                                  privilege of addressing the people—an
                                                  indignity, however, which after all redounded to
                                                  my honour. For, upon his forbidding me to do
                                                  anything but take the oath, I pronounced an oath
                                                  at once the most absolutely true and the most
                                                  glorious in a loud voice—an oath which
                                                  the people swore also in a loud voice to be
                                                  absolutely true. Though I had actually suffered
                                                  this signal indignity, I yet on that same day sent
                                                  common friends to Metellus to persuade him to
                                                  alter his resolution; to whom he answered that he
                                                  was no longer free to do so. And, in fact, a short
                                                  time previously he had said in a public meeting
                                                  that a man who had punished others without trial
                                                  ought not himself to be allowed the privilege of
                                                  speech. What a model of consistency! What an
                                                  admirable citizen! So he deemed the 
                                                  man who had saved the senate from massacre, the
                                                  city from the incendiary,,Italy,from war,
                                                  deserving of the same penalty as that inflicted by
                                                  the senate with the unanimous approval of all
                                                  loyal citizens, upon those who had intended to set
                                                  fire to the city, butcher magistrates and senate,
                                                  and stir up a formidable war! Accordingly, I did
                                                  withstand your brother Metellus to his face: for
                                                  on the 1st of January, in the senate, I maintained
                                                  a debate with him on the state of the Republic,
                                                  such as taught him that he had to contend with a
                                                  man of courage and firmness. On the 3rd of
                                                  January,,insert_note_157,7,on again opening the debate, he kept
                                                  harping on me and threatening me at every third
                                                  word of his speech; nor could any intention be
                                                  more deliberate than his was to overthrow me by
                                                  any means in his power, not by calm and judicial
                                                  argument, but by violence and mere browbeating. If
                                                  I had not shown some boldness and spirit in
                                                  opposing his intemperate attack, would not
                                                  everyone have concluded that the courage I had
                                                  displayed in my consulship was the result of
                                                  accident rather than design? If you did not know
                                                  that Metellus was contemplating these measures in
                                                  regard to me you must consider that you have been
                                                  kept in the dark by your brother on matters of the
                                                  utmost importance: if, on the other hand, he did
                                                  entrust any part of his designs to you, then
                                                  surely I ought to be regarded by you as a man of
                                                  placable and reasonable temper for not addressing
                                                  a word of reproach to you even on such occurrences
                                                  as these Understanding then that it was by no
                                                  ""mere word"" (as you express it) of Metellus that I
                                                  was roused, but by his deliberate policy and
                                                  extraordinary animosity towards me next observe my
                                                  forbearance—if ""forbearance"" is the name
                                                  to be given to irresolution and laxity under a
                                                  most galling indignity. I never once delivered a
                                                  vote in a speech against your brother every time a
                                                  motion was before the house I assented without
                                                  rising to those whose proposal appeared to me to
                                                  be the mildest. I will also add that, though in
                                                  the circumstances there was no obligation upon me
                                                  to do so, yet so far from raising objections I
                                                  actually did my best to secure that my enemy,  because he was your brother, should be
                                                  relieved from penalties by a decree of the senate.,insert_note_161,8,Wherefore I have not
                                                  ""attacked"" your brother, but only defended myself
                                                  from your brother's attack; nor have I been
                                                  ""fickle"" (to quote your word), but, on the
                                                  contrary, so constant, that I remained faithful to
                                                  my friendship to you, though left without any sign
                                                  of kindness from you. For instance, at this
                                                  moment, though your letter amounts almost to a
                                                  threat, I am writing back an answer such as you
                                                  see. I not only pardon your vexation, I even
                                                  applaud it in the highest degree; for my own heart
                                                  tells me how strong is the influence of fraternal
                                                  affection. I ask you in your turn to put a liberal
                                                  construction upon my vexation, and to conclude
                                                  that when attacked by your relatives with
                                                  bitterness, with brutality, and without cause, I
                                                  not only ought not to retract anything, but, in a
                                                  case of that kind, should even be able to rely
                                                  upon the aid of yourself and your army. I have
                                                  always wished to have you as a friend: I have
                                                  taken pains to make you understand that I am a
                                                  warm friend to you. I abide by that sentiment, and
                                                  shall abide by it as long as you will let me; and
                                                  I shall more readily cease to be angry with your
                                                  brother for love of you, than I shall from anger

                                                  been to see me, and begged me to try and secure
                                                  that no successor should be appointed to you this
                                                  turn. Though I regarded him as a man of good  character and attached to you, yet,
                                                  remembering the tenor of your previous letter to
                                                  me, I could not feel certain that the wishes of a
                                                  cautious man of the world like yourself had
                                                  undergone so complete a change. But after your
                                                  wife Cornelia had called on Terentia, and I had
                                                  had a conversation with Q. Cornelius, I took care
                                                  to be present at every meeting of the senate, and
                                                  found that the greatest trouble was to make Fufius
                                                  the tribune, and the others to whom you had
                                                  written, believe me rather than your own letters.
                                                  The whole business has, after all, been postponed

                                                  for 3,500 sestertia, a good while subsequent to
                                                  your congratulation. Accordingly, you may now look
                                                  upon me as being so deeply in debt as to be eager

The letters of this year are much concerned with the sacrilege of P. Clodius, who, it was alleged, had been detected in disguise in the house of the Pontifex Maximus Iulius Caesar, when his wife was celebrating the mysteries of the Bona Dea, from which males were excluded. His trial was made the occasion of bitter party struggles, and by giving evidence in contradiction of Clodius's alibi Cicero incurred his enmity, and eventually, therefore, his own exile.

The ordo equester is much irritated with the senate on the question of the contracts for the collection of the Asiatic taxes. XVI (A I, 12) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , I JANUARY The Teucris 1 business hangs fire, and Cornelius has not called on Terentia since. I suppose I must have recourse to Considius, Axius , and Selicius : 2 for his nearest relations can't get a penny out of Caecilius 3 a under twelve per cent. But to return to my first remark: I never saw anything more shameless, artful, and dilatory. I am on the point of sending my freedman, I have commissioned Titus —excuses and delays at every turn ! But perhaps it is a case of l'homme propose, 4 for Pompey's advance couriers tell me that he means to move in the senate that a successor to Antonius ought to be named, and the praetor intends to bring the proposal before the people at the same time. The facts are such that I cannot defend him in view of the opinion either of the aristocrats or the people, and, what is more than anything else, that I have no wish to do so. For a thing has happened into the truth of which I charge you to look thoroughly. I have a freedman, who is a worthless fellow enough; I mean Hilarus, an accountant and a client of your own. The interpreter Valerius gives me this information about him, and Thyillus writes me word that he has been told the same story: that the fellow is with Antonius, and that Antonius, in exacting money payments, frequently remarks that a part is being collected for me, and that I have sent a freedman to look after our common interests. I felt exceedingly disturbed, and yet could not believe it; but at any rate there has been some gossip of the sort. Pray look into the whole matter, learn the truth, find out the author, and get the empty-headed idiot out of the Country, if you possibly can. Valerius mentions Cn. Plancius as the origin of this gossip. I trust you thoroughly to investigate and find out what is at the bottom of it. I have good reason to believe that Pompey is most kindly disposed to me. His divorce of Mucia is strongly approved. 5 I suppose you have heard that P. Clodius, son of Appius, was caught in woman's clothes at Gaius Caesar's house, while the state function was going on, and that he was saved and got out by means of a maid-servant: and that the affair is causing immense scandal. I feel sure you will be sorry for it. 6 I have nothing else to tell you. And, indeed, at the moment of writing, I am in considerable distress: for a delightful youth, my reader Sosthenes, has just died, and his death has affected me more than that of a slave should, I think, do. Pray write often. If you have no news, write just what comes uppermost. 1 January, in the consulship of M. Messalla and M. Piso. XVII (F V, 5) TO C. ANTONIUS (IN MACEDONIA) ROME , JANUARY M. Cicero wishes health to Gaius Antonius, son of Marcus, Imperator. Though I had resolved to write you nothing but formal letters of introduction (not because I felt that they had much weight with you, but to avoid giving those who asked me for them an idea that there had been any diminution in our friendship), yet since Titus Pomponius is starting for your province, who knows better than anyone else all that I feel and have done for you, who desires your friendship and is most devotedly attached to me, I thought I must write something, especially as I had no other way of satisfying Pomponius himself. Were I to ask from you services of the greatest moment, it ought not to seem surprising to anyone: for you have not wanted from me any that concerned your interests, honour, or position. That no return has been made by you for these you are the best witness : that something even of a contrary nature has proceeded from you I have been told by many. I say told, for I do not venture to say discovered, 7 lest I should chance to use the word which people tell me is often falsely attributed to me by you. But the story which has reached my ears I would prefer your learning from Pomponius (who was equally hurt by it) rather than from my letter. How singularly loyal my feelings have been to you the senate and Roman people are both witnesses. How far you have been grateful to me you may yourself estimate: how much you owe me the rest of the world estimates. I was induced to do what I did for you at first by affection, and afterwards by consistency. Your future, believe me, stands in need of much greater zeal on my part, greater firmness and greater labour. 8 These labours, unless it shall appear that I am throwing away and wasting my pains, I shall support with all the strength I have; but if I see that they are not appreciated, I shall not allow you—the very person benefited 9 —to think me a fool for my pains. What the meaning of all this is you will be able to learn from Pomponius. In commending Pomponius to you, although I am sure you will do anything in your power for his own sake, yet I do beg that if you have any affection for me left, you will display it all in Pomponius's business. You can do me no greater favour than that. XVIII (A I, 13) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 27 JANUARY I have now received three letters from you—one by the hands of M. Cornelius, which you gave him, I think, at Three Taverns; a second which your host at Canusium delivered to me; a third dated, according to you, from on board your pinnace, when the cable was already slipped. 10 They were all three, to use a phrase from the schools of rhetoric flavoured with the salt of learning, and illumined with the marks of affection. In these letters, indeed, I am urgently pressed by you to send answers, but what renders me rather dilatory in this respect is the difficulty of finding a trustworthy carrier. How few of these gentry are able to convey a letter rather weightier than usual without lightening it by skimming its contents! Besides, I do not always care to send 11 whenever anyone is starting for Epirus : for I suppose that, having offered victims before your Amaltheia, 12 you at once started for the siege of Sicyon. And yet I am not even certain when you start to visit Antonius or how much time you are devoting to Epirus . Accordingly, I don't venture to trust either Achaeans or Epirotes with a letter somewhat more outspoken than usual. Now some events have occurred since you left me worth my writing to you, but they must not be trusted to the risk of a letter being lost, opened, or intercepted. Well, then, to begin with: I was not called upon to speak first, and the pacifier of the Allobroges 13 was preferred to me, and though this met with some murmurs of disapprobation from the senate, I was not sorry it was done. For I am thereby freed from any obligation to show respect to an ill-conditioned man, and am at liberty to support my position in the Republic in spite of him. Besides, the second place has a dignity almost equal to that of princeps senatus , and does not put one under too much of an obligation to the consul. The third called on was Catulus; the fourth, if you want to go still farther, Hortensius. The consul himself 14 is a man of a small and ill-regulated mind, a mere buffoon of that splenetic kind which raises a laugh even in the absence of wit: it is his face rather than his facetiousness 15 that causes merriment : he takes practically no part in public business, and is quite alienated from the Optimates. You need expect no service to the state from him, for he has not the will to do any, nor fear any damage, for he hasn't the courage to inflict it. His colleague, however, treats me with great distinction, and is also a zealous supporter of the loyalist party. For the present their disagreement has not come to much; but I fear that this taint may spread farther. For I suppose you have heard that when the state function was being performed in Caesar's house a man in woman's dress got in, 16 and that the Vestals having performed the rite again, mention was made of the matter in the senate by Q. Cornificius—he was the first, so don't think that it was one of us consulars—and that on the matter being referred by a decree of the senate to the [Virgins and] pontifices, they decided that a sacrilege had been committed: that then, on a farther decree of the senate, the consuls published a bill: and that Caesar divorced his wife. On this question Piso, from friendship for P. Clodius, is doing his best to get the bill promulgated by himself (though in accordance with a decree of the senate and on a point of religion) rejected. Messalla as yet is strongly for severe measures. The loyalists hold aloof owing to the entreaties of Clodius : bands of ruffians are being got together: I myself, at first a stern Lycurgus, am becoming daily less and less keen about it: Cato is hot and eager. In short, I fear that between the indifference of the loyalists and the support of the disloyal it may be the cause of great evils to the Republic. However, your great friend 17 —do you know whom I mean ?—of whom you said in your letter that, not venturing to blame me, he was beginning to be complimentary, is now to all appearance exceedingly fond of me, embraces me, loves and praises me in public, while in secret (though unable to disguise it) he is jealous of me. No good-breeding, no straightforwardness, no political morality, no distinction, no courage, no liberality! But on these points I will write to you more minutely at another time; for in the first place I am not yet quite sure about them, and in the next place I dare not entrust a letter on such weighty matters to such a casual nobody's son as this messenger. The praetors have not yet drawn their lots for the provinces. The matter remains just where you left it. The description of the scenery of Misenum and Puteoli which you ask for I will include in my speech. 18 I had already noticed the mistake in the date, 3rd of December. The points in my speeches which you praise, believe me, I liked very much myself, but did not venture to say so before. Now, however, as they have received your approval, I think them much more Attic than ever. To the speech in answer to Metellus. 19 I have made some additions. The book shall be sent you, since affection for me gives you a taste for rhetoric. What news have I for you? Let me see. Oh, yes! The consul Messalla has bought Antonius's house for 3,400 sestertia. What is that to me? you will say. Why, thus much. The price has convinced people that I made no bad bargain, and they begin to understand that in making a purchase a man may properly use his friends' means to get what suits his position. The Teucris affair drags on, yet I have hopes. Pray settle the business you have in hand. You shall have a more outspoken letter soon. 27 January, in the consulship of M. Messalla and M. Piso. XIX (A I, 14) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 13 FEBRUARY I fear it may seem affectation to tell you how occupied I have been; but I am so distracted with business that I have only just found time for this short letter, and that has been stolen from the most urgent engagements. I have already described to you Pompey's first public speech—it did not please the poor, nor satisfy the disloyal, nor find favour with the wealthy, nor appear sound to the loyalists; accordingly, he is down in the world. 20 Presently, on the instigation of the consul Piso, that most insignificant of tribunes, Fufius, brought Pompey on to the platform. The meeting was in the circus Flaminius , and there was in the same place that day a crowd of market people—a kind of tiers état. 21 He asked him to say whether he approved of the jurymen being selected by the praetor, to form a panel for the praetor himself to employ. That was the regulation made by the senate in the matter of Clodius's sacrilege. Thereupon Pompey made a highly aristocratic speech, and replied (and at great length) that in all matters the authority of the senate was of the greatest weight in his eyes and had always been so. Later on the consul Messalla in the senate asked Pompey his opinion as to the sacrilege and the bill that had been published. His speech in the senate amounted to a general commendation of all decrees of the house, and when he sat down he said to me, I think my answer covers your case also. 22 When Crassus observed that Pompey had got a cheer from the idea in men's minds that he approved my consulship, he rose also to. his feet and delivered a speech in the most complimentary terms on my consulship, going so far as to say that he owed it to me that he was still a senator, a citizen, nay, a free man; and that he never beheld wife, home, or country without beholding the fruits of my conduct. In short: that whole topic, which I am wont to paint in various colours in my speeches (of which you are the Aristarchus), the fire, the sword—you know my paint-pots—he elaborated to the highest pitch. I was sitting next to Pompey. I noticed that he was agitated, either at Crassus earning the gratitude which he had himself neglected, or to think that my achievements were, after all, of such magnitude that the senate was so glad to hear them praised, especially by a man who was the less under an obligation to praise me, because in everything I ever wrote 23 my praise of Pompey was practically a reflection on him. This day has brought me very close to Crassus, and yet in spite of all I accepted with pleasure any compliment—open or covert—from Pompey. But as for my own speech, good heavens! how I did put it on for the benefit of my new auditor Pompey! If I ever did bring every art into play, I did then—period, transition, enthymeme, deduction—everything. In short, I was cheered to the echo. For the subject of my speech was the dignity of the senate, its harmony with the equites, the unanimity of Italy , the dying embers of the conspiracy, the fall in prices, the establishment of peace. You know my thunder when these are my themes. It was so loud, in fact, that I may cut short my description, as I think you must have heard it even in Epirus . The state of things at Rome is this: the senate is a perfect Areopagus. You cannot conceive anything firmer, more grave, or more high-spirited. For when the day came for proposing the bill in accordance with the vote of the senate, a crowd of our dandies with their chin-tufts assembled, all the Catiline set, with Curio's girlish son at their head, and implored the people to reject it. Moreover, Piso the consul, who formally introduced the bill, spoke against it. Clodius's hired ruffians had filled up the entrances to the voting boxes. The voting tickets were so manipulated that no ayes were distributed. Hereupon imagine Cato hurrying to the rostra, delivering an admirable invective against the consul, if we can call that an ''invective which was really a speech of the utmost weight and authority, and in fact containing the most salutary advice. He is followed to the same effect by your friend Hortensius, and many loyalists besides, among whom, however, the contribution of Favonius was conspicuous. By this rally of the Optimates the comitia is dissolved, the senate summoned. On the question being put in a full house—in spite of the opposition of Piso, and in spite of Clodius throwing himself at the feet of the senators one after the other—that the consuls should exhort the people to pass the bill, about fifteen voted with Curio, who was against any decree being passed; on the other side there were fully four hundred. So the vote passed. The tribune Fufius then gave in. 24 Clodius delivered some wretched speeches to the people, in which he bestowed some injurious epithets on Lucullus, Hortensius, C. Piso, and the consul Messalla; me he only charged with having discovered everything. 25 In regard to the assignation of provinces to the praetors, the hearing legations, and other business, the senate voted that nothing should be brought before it till the bill had been brought before the people. There is the state of things at Rome for you. Yet pray listen to this one thing more which has surpassed my hopes. Messalla is a superlatively good consul, courageous, firm, painstaking; he praises, shows attachment to, and imitates me. That other one (Piso) is the less mischievous because of one vice—he is lazy, sleepy, unbusinesslike, an utter fainéant, but in intention he is so disaffected that he has begun to loathe Pompey since he made the speech in which some praise was bestowed on the senate. Accordingly, he has alienated all the loyalists to a remarkable degree. And his action is not dictated by love for Clodius more than by a taste for a profligate policy and a profligate party. But he has nobody among the magistrates like himself, with the single exception of the tribune Fufius. The tribunes are excellent, and in Cornutus we have a quasi-Cato. Can I say more? Now to return to private matters. Teucris has fulfilled her promise. 26 Pray execute the commission you undertook. My brother Quintus, who purchased the remaining three-fourths of the house in the Argiletum for 725 sestertia, is now trying to sell his Tusculan property, in order to purchase, if he can, the town house of Pacilius. Make it up with Lucceius! I see that he is all agog to stand for the consulship. I will do my best. Be careful to let me know exactly how you are, where you are, and how your business goes on. 13 February. XX (A I, 15) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 15 MARCH You have heard that my dearest brother Quintus has got Asia ; for I do not doubt that rumour has conveyed the news to you quicker than a letter from any of us. Now then, considering how desirous of a good reputation he and I have ever been, and how unusually Philhellenic we are and have the reputation of being, and considering how many there are whose enmity we have incurred for the sake of the Republic, call to mind all your valour, 27 to secure us the praise and affection of all concerned. I will write at greater length to you on these points in the letter which I shall give to Quintus himself. 28 Please let me know what you have done about the business I confided to you, and also in your own affair; for I have had no letter from you since you left Brundisium . I am very anxious to hear how you are. 15 March. XXI (A 1,16) TO ATTICUS ROME (MAY) You ask me what has happened about the trial, the result of which was so contrary to the general expectation, and at the same time you want to know how I came to make a worse fight of it than usual. I will answer the last first. after the manner of Homer. 29 The fact is that, so long as I had to defend the authority of the senate, 30 I battled with such gallantry and vigour that there were shouts of applause and crowds round me in the house ringing with my praise. Nay, if you ever thought that I showed courage in political business, you certainly would have admired my conduct in that cause. For when the culprit had betaken himself to public meetings, and had made an invidious use of my name, immortal gods! What battles! What havoc! What sallies I made upon Piso, Curio, on the whole of that set! How I fell upon the old men for their instability, on the young for their profligacy! Again and again, so help me heaven! I regretted your absence not only as the supporter of my policy, but as the spectator also of my admirable fighting. However, when Hortensius hit on the idea of a law as to the sacrilege being proposed by the tribune Fufius, in which there was no difference from the bill of the consul except as to the kind of jurymen—on that point, however, the whole question turned—and got it carried by sheer fighting, because he had persuaded himself and others that he could not get an acquittal no matter who were the jurymen, I drew in my sails, seeing the neediness of the jurors, and gave no evidence beyond what was so notorious and well attested that I could not omit it. 31 Therefore, if you ask reason of the acquittal—to return at length to the former of the two questions —it was entirely the poverty and low character of the jury. But that this was possible was entirely the result of Hortensius's policy. In his alarm lest Fufius should veto the law which was to be proposed in virtue of a senatorial decree, he failed to see that it was better that the culprit should be left under a cloud of disgrace and dishonour than that he should be trusted to the discretion of a weak jury. But in his passionate resentment he hastened to bring the case into court, saying that a leaden sword was good enough to cut his throat. But if you want to know the history of the trial, with its incredible verdict, it was such that Hortensius's policy is now blamed by other people after the event, though I disapproved of it from the first. When the rejection of jurors had taken place, amidst loud cheers and counter-cheers—the accuser like a strict censor rejecting the most worthless, the defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators all the best—as soon as the jury had taken their seats, the loyalists at once began to feel distrust. There never was a seedier lot round a table in a gambling hell. Senators under a cloud, equites out at elbows, tribunes who were not so much made of money as collectors of it, according to their official title. 32 However, there were a few honest men in the panel, whom he had been unable to drive off it by rejection, and they took their seats among their uncongenial comrades with gloomy looks and signs of emotion, and were keenly disgusted at having to rub elbows with such rascals. Hereupon, as question after question was referred to the panel in the preliminary proceedings, the severity of the decisions passes belief: there was no disagreement in voting, the defendant carried none of his points, while the accuser got even more than he asked. He was triumphant. Need I say more? Hortensius would have it that he was the only one of us who had seen the truth. There was not a man who did not think it impossible for him to stand his trial without being condemned a thousand times over. Further, when I was produced as a witness, I suppose you have been told how the shouts of Clodius's supporters were answered by the jury rising to their feet to gather round me, and openly to offer their throats to P. Clodius in my defence. This seemed to me a greater compliment than the well-known occasion when your fellow citizens 33 stopped Xenocrates from taking an oath in the witness-box, or when, upon the accounts of Metellus Numidicus 34 being as usual handed round, a Roman jury refused to look at them. The compliment paid me, I repeat, was much greater. Accordingly, as the jurymen were protecting me as the mainstay of the country, it was by their voices that the defendant was overwhelmed, and with him all his advocates suffered a crushing blow. Next day my house was visited by as great a throng as that which escorted me home when I laid down the consulship. Our eminent Areopagites then exclaimed that they would not come into court unless a guard was assigned them. The question was put to the whole panel: there was only one vote against the need of a guard. The question is brought before the senate: the decree is passed in the most solemn and laudatory terms : the jurymen are complimented: the magistrates are commissioned to carry it out: no one thought that the fellow would venture on a defence. Tell me, ye Muses, now how first the fire befell ! 35 You know Bald-head, the Nanneian millionaire, 36 that panegyrist of mine, whose complimentary oration I have already mentioned to you in a letter. In two days' time, by the agency of a single slave, and one, too, from a school of gladiators, he settled the whole business—he summoned them to an interview, made a promise, offered security, paid money down. Still farther, good heavens, what a scandal! even favours from certain ladies, and introductions to young men of rank, were thrown in as a kind of pourboire to some of the jurors. Accordingly, with the loyalists holding completely aloof, with the forum full of slaves, twenty-five jurors were yet found so courageous that, though at the risk of their lives, they preferred even death to producing universal ruin. There were thirty-one who were more influenced by famine than fame. On seeing one of these latter Catulus said to him, Why did you ask us for a guard? Did you fear being robbed of the money? There you have, as briefly as I could put it, the nature of the trial and the cause of the acquittal. Next you want to know the present state of public affairs and of my own. That settlement of the Republic—firmly established by my wisdom, as you thought, as I thought by God's—which seemed fixed on a sure foundation by the unanimity of all loyalists and the influence of my consulship—that I assure you, unless some God take compassion on us, has by this one verdict escaped from our grasp: if verdict it is to be called, when thirty of the most worthless and dissolute fellows in Rome for a paltry sum of money obliterate every principle of law and justice, and when that which every man—I had almost said every animal—knows to have taken place, a Thalna, a Plautus, and a Spongia, and other scum of that sort decide not to have taken place. However, to console you as to the state of the Republic, rascaldom is not as cheerful and exultant in its victory as the disloyal hoped after the infliction of such a wound upon the Republic. For they fully expected that when religion, morality, the honour of juries, and the prestige of the senate had sustained such a crushing fall, victorious profligacy and lawless lust would openly exact vengeance from all the best men for the mortification which the strictness of my consulship had branded in upon all the worst. And it is once more I—for I do not feel as if I were boasting vaingloriously when speaking of myself to you, especially in a letter not intended to be read by others—it was I once more, I say, who revived the fainting spirits of the loyalists, cheering and encouraging each personally. Moreover, by my denunciations and invectives against those corrupt jurors I left none of the favourers and supporters of that victory a word to say for themselves. I gave the consul Piso no rest anywhere, I got him deprived of Syria , which had been already plighted to him, I revived the fainting spirit of the senate and recalled it to its former severity. I overwhelmed Clodius in the senate to his face, both in a set speech, very weighty and serious, and also in an interchange of repartees, of which I append a specimen for your delectation. The rest lose all point and grace without the excitement of the contest, or, as you Greeks call it, the ἀγών . Well, at the meeting of the senate on the 15th of May, being called on for my opinion, I spoke at considerable length on the high interests of the Republic, and brought in the following passage by a happy inspiration: Do not, Fathers, regard yourselves as fallen utterly, do not faint, because you have received one blow. The wound is one which I cannot disguise, but which I yet feel sure should not be regarded with extreme fear: to fear would show us to be the greatest of cowards, to ignore it the greatest of fools. Lentulus was twice acquitted, so was Catiline, a third such criminal has now been let loose by jurors upon the Republic. You are mistaken, Clodius: it is not for the city but for the prison that the jurors have reserved you, and their intention was not to retain you in the state, but to deprive you of the privilege of exile. Wherefore, Fathers, rouse up all your courage, hold fast to your high calling. There still remains in the Republic the old unanimity of the loyalists: their feelings have been outraged, their resolution has not been weakened: no fresh mischief has been done, only what was actually existing has been discovered. In the trial of one profligate many like him have been detected. —But what am I about? I have copied almost a speech into a letter. I return to the duel of words. Up gets our dandified young gentleman, and throws in my teeth my having been at Baiae . It wasn't true, but what did that matter to him? It is as though you were to say, replied I, that I had been in disguise! What business, quoth he, has an Arpinate with hot baths? Say that to your patron, said I, who Coveted the watering-place of an Arpinate. 37 For you know about the marine villa. How long, said he, are we to put up with this king? Do you mention a king, quoth I, when Rex 38 made no mention of you? He, you know, had swallowed the inheritance of Rex in anticipation. You have bought a house, says he. You would think that he said, quoth I, you have bought a jury. They didn't trust you on your oath, said he. Yes, said I, twenty-five jurors did trust me, thirty-one didn't trust you, for they took care to get their money beforehand. Here he was overpowered by a burst of applause and broke down without a word to say. My own position is this: with the loyalists I hold the same place as when you left town, with the tagrag and bobtail of the City I hold a much better one than at your departure. For it does me no harm that my evidence appears not to have availed. Envy has been let blood without causing pain, and even more so from the fact that all the supporters of that flagitious proceeding confess that a perfectly notorious fact has been hushed up by bribing the jury. Besides, the wretched starveling mob, the blood-sucker of the treasury, imagines me to be high in the favour of Magnus—and indeed we have been mutually united by frequent pleasant intercourse to such an extent, that our friends the boon companions of the conspiracy, the young chin-tufts, speak of him in ordinary conversation as Gnaeus Cicero. Accordingly, both in the circus and at the gladiatorial games, I received a remarkable ovation without a single cat-call. There is at present a lively anticipation of the elections, in which, contrary to everybody's wishes, our friend Magnus is pushing the claims of Aulus's son; 39 and in that matter his weapons are neither his prestige nor his popularity, but those by which Philip said that any fortress could be taken—if only an ass laden with gold could make its way up into it. Furthermore, that precious consul, playing as it were second fiddle to Pompey, 40 is said to have undertaken the business and to have bribery agents at his house, which I don't believe. But two decrees have already passed the house of an unpopular character, because they are thought to be directed against the consul on the demand of Cato and Domitius 41 —one that search should be allowed in magistrates' houses, and a second, that all who had bribery agents in their houses were guilty of treason. The tribune Lurco also, having entered on his office irregularly in view of the Aelian law, has been relieved from the provisions both of the Aelian and Fufian laws, in order to enable him to propose his law on bribery, which he promulgated with correct auspices though a cripple. 42 Accordingly, the comitia have been postponed to the 27th of July. There is this novelty in his bill, that a man who has promised money among the tribes, but not paid it, is not liable, but, if he has paid, he is liable for life to pay 3,000 sesterces to each tribe. I remarked that P. Clodius had obeyed this law by anticipation, for he was accustomed to promise, and not pay. But observe! Don't you see that the consulship of which we thought so much, which Curio used of old to call an apotheosis, if this Afranius is elected, will become a mere farce and mockery? Therefore I think one should play the philosopher, as you in fact do, and not care a straw for your consulships ! You say in your letter that you have decided not to go to Asia . For my part I should have preferred your going, and I fear that there may be some offence 43 given in that matter. Nevertheless, I am not the man to blame you, especially considering that I have not gone to a province myself. I shall be quite Content with the inscriptions you have placed in your 44 Amaltheium, especially as Thyillus has deserted me and Archias written nothing about me. The latter, I am afraid, having composed a Greek poem on the Luculli, is now turning his attention to the Caecilian drama. 45 I have thanked Antonius on your account, and I have intrusted the letter to Mallius I have heretofore written to you more rarely because I had no one to whom I could trust a letter, and was not sure of your address. I have puffed you well. If Cincius should refer any business of yours to me, I will undertake it. But at present he is more intent on his own business, in which I am rendering him some assistance. If you mean to stay any length of time in one place you may expect frequent letters from me: but pray send even more yourself. I wish you would describe your Amaltheium to me, its decoration and its plan; and send me any poems or stories you may have about Amaltheia. 46 I should like to make a copy of it at Arpinum . I will forward you something of what I have written. At present there is nothing finished. XXII (A I, 17) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 5 DECEMBER Your letter, in which you inclose copies of his letters, has made me realize that my brother Quintus's feelings have undergone many alternations, and that his opinions and judgments have varied widely from time to time. 47 This has not only caused me all the pain which my extreme affection for both of you was bound to bring, but it has also made me wonder what can have happened to cause my brother Quintus such deep offence, or such an extraordinary change of feeling. And yet I was already aware, as I saw that you also, when you took leave of me, were beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that his feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had sunk deep into his heart. On trying on several previous occasions, but more eagerly than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage these feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand that the extent of his offence was so great as your letter indicates; but on the other I did not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished. However, I consoled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing you at Dyrrachium , or somewhere in your part of the country: and, if that happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be made smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual explanation, but by the very sight of each other in such an interview. For I need not say in writing to you, who know it quite well, how kind and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is sensitive in taking offence. But it most unfortunately happened that you did not see him anywhere. For the impression he had received from the artifices of others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the old affection so long existing between you, which ought to have been the strongest influence of all. And yet, as to where the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since I am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours. For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by members of the family, they yet could at least have cured it. But the root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps extends farther than appears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet. As to the letter he sent to you from Thessalonica , 48 and about the language which you suppose him to have used both at Rome among your friends and on his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but my whole hope of removing this unpleasantness rests on your kindness. For if you will only make up your mind to believe that the best men are often those whose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this quickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally signs of a good heart and lastly—and this is the main thing—that we must mutually put up with each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?), or faults, or injurious acts, then these misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed away. I beg you to take this view, for it is the dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that there should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you and is not loved by you. That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you mention what opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city you let pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship: for I am thoroughly persuaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did I ever think that there was any difference between you and me except in our choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek official advancement, while another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an honourable privacy. In the true glory, which is founded on honesty, industry, and piety, I place neither myself nor anyone else above you. In affection towards myself, next to my brother and immediate family, I put you first. For indeed, indeed I have seen and thoroughly appreciated how your anxiety and joy have corresponded with the variations of my fortunes. Often has your congratulation added a charm to praise, and your consolation a welcome antidote to alarm. Nay, at this moment of your absence, it is not only your advice—in which you excel—but the interchange of speech—in which no one gives me so much delight as you do—that I miss most, shall I say in politics, in which circumspection is always incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly sustained with a view to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain my position by securing popularity, or in the mere business of my family? In all these I missed you and our conversations before my brother left Rome , and still more do I miss them since. Finally, neither my work nor rest, neither my business nor leisure, neither my affairs in the forum or at home, public or private, can any longer do without your most consolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation. The modest reserve which characterizes both of us has often prevented my mentioning these facts; but on this occasion it was rendered necessary by that part of your letter in which you expressed a wish to have yourself and your character put straight and cleared in my eyes. Yet, in the midst of all this unfortunate alienation and anger, there is one fortunate circumstance—that your determination of not going to a province was known to me and your other friends, and had been at various times before distinctly expressed by yourself; so that your not being his guest may be attributed to your personal tastes and judgments, not to the quarrel and rupture between you. And so those ties which have been broken will be restored, and ours which have been so religiously preserved will retain all their old inviolability. At Rome I find politics in a shaky condition; everything is unsatisfactory and foreboding change. For I have no doubt you have been told that our friends, the equites, are all but alienated from the senate. Their first grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the authority of the senate for the trial of such as had taken bribes for giving a verdict. I happened not to be in the house when that decree was passed, but when I found that the equestrian order was indignant at it, and yet refrained from openly saying so, I remonstrated with the senate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and was very weighty and eloquent considering the unsatisfactory nature of my cause. But here is another piece of almost intolerable coolness on the part of the equites, which I have not only submitted to, but have even put in as good a light as possible! The companies which had contracted with the censors for Asia complained that in the heat of the competition they had taken the contract at an excessive price; they demanded that the contract should be annulled. I led in their support, or rather, I was second, for it was Crassus who induced them to venture on this demand. The case is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession of rash speculation. Yet there was a very great risk that, if they got no concession, they would be completely alienated from the senate. Here again I came to the rescue more than anyone else, and secured them a full and very friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of December, delivered long speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two orders. The business is not yet settled, but the favourable feeling of the senate has been made manifest: for no one had spoken against it except the consul-designate, Metellus; while our hero Cato had still to speak, the shortness of the day having prevented his turn being reached. Thus I, in the maintenance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability that harmony of the orders which was originally my joiner's work; but since it all now seems in such a crazy condition, I am constructing what I may call a road towards the maintenance of our power, a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe to you in a letter, but of which I will nevertheless give you a hint. I cultivate close intimacy with Pompey. I foresee what you will say. I will use all necessary precautions, and I will write another time at greater length about my schemes for managing the Republic. You must know that Lucceius has it in his mind to stand for the consulship at once; for there are said to be only two candidates in prospect. Caesar is thinking of coming to terms with him by the agency of Arrius, and Bibulus also thinks he may effect a coalition with him by means of C. Piso. 49 You smile? This is no laughing matter, believe me. What else shall I write to you? What? I have plenty to say, but must put it off to another time. If you mean to wait till you hear, let me know. For the moment I am satisfied with a modest request, though it is what I desire above everything—that you should come to Rome as soon as possible. 5 December.","Note: 1 From                                                   expressions in the following letters it seems                                                   certain that this refers to money expected from                                                   Gaius Antonius; but we have no means of deciding                                                   whether or no Teucris is a pseudonym for some agent. Cicero had                                                   undertaken to be the advocate and supporter of                                                   Antonius, and though as an actual patronus in court he could not                                                   take money, he may have felt justified in                                                   receiving supplies from him. Still, he knew the                                                   character of Antonius, and how such wealth was                                                   likely to be got, and it is not a pleasant affair.,Note: 2 Money-lenders.,Note: 3 The rich and cross-grained uncle of Atticus .

The celebration referred to here took place                                                   on the night between the 3rd and 4th of December.                                                   It was a state function ( pro  populo ), and was celebrated in the                                                   presence of the Vestals and the wife of the consul or praetor  urbanus , in  ea  domo  quae  est  in  imperio .

Cicero playfully supposes that Atticus only stayed                                                   in his villa in Epirus to offer sacrifices to the                                                   nymph in his gymnasium, and then hurried off to  Sicyon  , where people owed him money which he                                                   wanted to get. He goes to Antonius first to get                                                   his authority for putting pressure on Sicyon , and perhaps even some                                                   military force.,Note: 13 C. Calpurnius Piso ( consul B.C. 67), brother of the consul of the year,                                                   had been governor of Gallia  Narbonensis (B.C.                                                   66-65), and had suppressed a rising of the Allobroges , the most                                                   troublesome tribe in the province, who were, in                                                   fact, again in rebellion.,Note: 14 M.

No speech                                                   exists containing such a description, but we have                                                   only two of the previous year extant ( pro  Flacco and pro  Archia  Poeta ). Cicero was                                                   probably sending it, whichever it was, to Atticus to be copied by his librarii , and                                                   published. Atticus had apparently some other works of Cicero's in                                                   hand, for which he had sent him some  queries.,Note: 19 Apparently the speech in the senate referred                                                   to in Letter XIV, p. 23, spoken on 1st January,                                                   B.C. 62. Metellus had                                                   prevented his contio the day before.,Note: 20 The letter giving this                                                   description is lost. I think frigebat is epistolary                                                   imperfect— he is in the cold shade,                                                    not,  it fell flat.,Note: 21  πανήγυρις . Cicero                                                   uses the word (an honourable one in Greek)                                                   contemptuously of the rabble brought together at a                                                   market.,Note: 22 Pompey's general                                                   commendation of the decrees of the senate would                                                   include those regarding the Catiline conspirators, and he therefore                                                   claimed to have satisfied Cicero.,Note: 23  Meis  omnibus  litteris , the MS. reading.

Meis  litteris is well supported by literae  forenses  et  senatoriae of de Off. 2.3 , and                                                   though it is an unusual mode of referring to                                                   speeches, we must remember that they were now                                                   published and were  literature.  The particular                                                   reference is to the speech pro Imperio                                                   Pompeii , in which, among other things, the                                                   whole credit of the reduction of Spartacus's                                                   gladiators is given to Pompey, whereas the brunt                                                   of the war had been borne by Crassus.,Note: 24 Fufius, though Cicero                                                   does not say so, must have vetoed the decree, but                                                   in the face of such a majority withdrew his veto.                                                   The practice seems to have been, in case of                                                   tribunician veto, to take the vote, which remained                                                   as an auctoritas  senatus , but was not a senatus  consultum unless the                                                   tribune was induced to withdraw.,Note: 25  Comperisse .

Caesar and Bibulus were elected, and apparently                                                   were the only two candidates declared as yet. They                                                   were, of course, extremists, and Lucceius seems to                                                   reckon on getting in by forming a coalition with                                                   either one or the other, and so getting the                                                   support of one of the extreme parties, with the                                                   moderates, for himself. The bargain eventually                                                   made was between Lucceius and Caesar, the former                                                   finding the money.

                                                  proposal before the people at the same time. The
                                                  facts are  such that I cannot defend

                                                  charge you to look thoroughly. I have a freedman,
                                                  who is a worthless fellow enough; I mean Hilarus,
                                                  an accountant and a client of your own. The
                                                  interpreter Valerius gives me this information
                                                  about him, and Thyillus writes me word that he has
                                                  been told the same story: that the fellow is with
                                                  Antonius, and that Antonius, in exacting money
                                                  payments, frequently remarks that a part is being
                                                  collected for me, and that I have sent a freedman
                                                  to look after our common interests. I felt
                                                  exceedingly disturbed, and yet could not believe
                                                  it; but at any rate there has been some gossip of
                                                  the sort. Pray look into the whole matter, learn
                                                  the truth, find out the author, and get the
                                                  empty-headed idiot out of the Country, if you
                                                  possibly can. Valerius mentions Cn. Plancius as
                                                  the origin of this gossip. I trust you thoroughly
                                                  to investigate and find out what is at the bottom
                                                  of it. I have good reason to believe that Pompey
                                                  is most kindly disposed to me. His divorce of

                                                  a maid-servant: and that the affair is causing

                                                  urgently pressed by you to send answers, but what
                                                  renders me rather dilatory in this respect is the
                                                  difficulty of finding a trustworthy carrier. How
                                                  few of these gentry are able to convey a letter
                                                  rather weightier than usual without lightening it
                                                  by skimming its contents! Besides, I do not always

                                                  you are devoting to,Epirus,. Accordingly, I don't venture
                                                  to trust either Achaeans or Epirotes with a letter
                                                  somewhat more outspoken than usual. Now some

                                                  intercepted.,Well, then,
                                                  to begin with: I was not called upon to speak
                                                  first, and the pacifier of the Allobroges,insert_note_155,13,was preferred to
                                                  me, and though this met with some murmurs of
                                                  disapprobation from the senate, I was not sorry it
                                                  was done. For I am thereby freed from any
                                                  obligation to show respect to an ill-conditioned
                                                  man, and am at liberty to support my position in
                                                  the Republic in spite of him. Besides, the second
                                                  place has a dignity almost equal to that of,princeps,,senatus,, and
                                                  does not put one under too much of an obligation
                                                  to the consul. The third called on was Catulus;
                                                  the fourth, if you want to go still farther,
                                                  Hortensius. The consul himself,insert_note_166,14,is a man of a small and
                                                  ill-regulated mind, a mere buffoon of that
                                                  splenetic kind which raises a laugh even in the
                                                  absence of wit: it is his face rather than his
                                                  facetiousness,insert_note_170,15,that causes
                                                  merriment : he takes practically no part in public
                                                  business, and is quite alienated from the
                                                  Optimates. You need expect no service to the state
                                                  from him, for he has not the will to do any, nor
                                                   fear any damage, for he hasn't the
                                                  courage to inflict it. His colleague, however,
                                                  treats me with great distinction, and is also a
                                                  zealous supporter of the loyalist party. For the
                                                  present their disagreement has not come to much;
                                                  but I fear that this taint may spread farther. For
                                                  I suppose you have heard that when the state
                                                  function was being performed in Caesar's house a

                                                  Vestals having performed the rite again, mention
                                                  was made of the matter in the senate by Q.
                                                  Cornificius—he was the first, so don't
                                                  think that it was one of us
                                                  consulars—and that on the matter being
                                                  referred by a decree of the senate to the [Virgins
                                                  and] pontifices, they decided that a sacrilege had
                                                  been committed: that then, on a farther decree of
                                                  the senate, the consuls published a bill: and that
                                                  Caesar divorced his wife. On this question Piso,
                                                  from friendship for P. Clodius, is doing his best
                                                  to get the bill promulgated by himself (though in
                                                  accordance with a decree of the senate and on a

                                                  less keen about it: Cato is hot and eager. In
                                                  short, I fear that between the indifference of the
                                                  loyalists and the support of the disloyal it may
                                                  be the cause of great evils to the Republic.

                                                  unable to disguise it) he is jealous of me. No

                                                  affection for me gives you a taste for rhetoric.
                                                  What news have I for you? Let me see. Oh, yes! The

                                                  Why, thus much. The price has convinced people
                                                  that I made no bad bargain, and they begin to
                                                  understand that in making a purchase a man may

                                                  stolen from the most urgent engagements. I have
                                                  already described to you Pompey's first public
                                                  speech—it did not please the poor, nor

                                                  instigation of the consul Piso, that most
                                                  insignificant of tribunes, Fufius, brought Pompey
                                                  on to the platform. The meeting was in the,circus,,Flaminius,, and
                                                  there was in the same place that day a crowd of
                                                  market people—a kind of tiers état.,insert_note_231,21,He asked him to say whether he
                                                  approved of the jurymen being selected by the
                                                  praetor, to form a panel for the praetor himself
                                                  to employ. That was the regulation made by the
                                                  senate in the matter of Clodius's sacrilege.
                                                  Thereupon Pompey made a highly ""aristocratic""
                                                  speech, and replied (and at great length) that in
                                                  all matters the authority of the senate was of the
                                                  greatest weight in his eyes and had always been
                                                  so. Later on the consul Messalla in the senate
                                                  asked Pompey his opinion as to the sacrilege and
                                                  the bill that had been published. His speech in
                                                  the senate amounted to a general commendation of
                                                  all decrees of the house, and when he sat down he
                                                  said to me, ""I think my answer covers your case
                                                  also."",insert_note_235,22,When
                                                  Crassus observed that Pompey had got a cheer from
                                                  the idea in men's minds that he approved my
                                                  consulship, he rose also to. his feet and
                                                  delivered a speech in the most complimentary terms
                                                  on my consulship, going so far as to say that he
                                                  owed it to me that he was still a senator, a
                                                  citizen, nay, a free man; and that he never beheld
                                                  wife, home, or country without beholding the
                                                  fruits of my conduct. In short: that whole topic,
                                                  which I am wont to paint in various colours in my
                                                  speeches (of which you are the Aristarchus), the
                                                  fire, the sword—you know my
                                                  paint-pots—he elaborated to the highest
                                                  pitch. I was sitting next to Pompey. I noticed
                                                  that he was agitated, either at Crassus earning
                                                  the gratitude which he had himself neglected, or
                                                  to think that my achievements  were,
                                                  after all, of such magnitude that the senate was
                                                  so glad to hear them praised, especially by a man
                                                  who was the less under an obligation to praise me,
                                                  because in everything I ever wrote,insert_note_239,23,my
                                                  praise of Pompey was practically a reflection on
                                                  him. This day has brought me very close to
                                                  Crassus, and yet in spite of all I accepted with
                                                  pleasure any compliment—open or
                                                  covert—from Pompey. But as for my own
                                                  speech, good heavens! how I did ""put it on"" for
                                                  the benefit of my new auditor Pompey! If I ever
                                                  did bring every art into play, I did
                                                  then—period, transition, enthymeme,
                                                  deduction—everything. In short, I was
                                                  cheered to the echo. For the subject of my speech
                                                  was the dignity of the senate, its harmony with
                                                  the equites, the unanimity of,Italy,, the dying
                                                  embers of the conspiracy, the fall in prices, the
                                                  establishment of peace. You know my thunder when
                                                  these are my themes. It was so loud, in fact, that
                                                  I may cut short my description, as I think you
                                                  must have heard it even in,Epirus,.,The state of things at,Rome,is this: the
                                                  senate is a perfect Areopagus. You cannot conceive
                                                  anything firmer, more grave, or more
                                                  high-spirited. For when the day came for proposing
                                                  the bill in accordance with the vote of the
                                                  senate, a crowd of our dandies with their
                                                  chin-tufts assembled, all the Catiline set, with
                                                  Curio's girlish son at their head, and implored
                                                  the people to reject it. Moreover, Piso the
                                                  consul, who formally introduced the bill, spoke
                                                  against it. Clodius's hired ruffians had filled up
                                                  the entrances to the voting boxes. The voting
                                                  tickets were so manipulated that no ""ayes"" were
                                                  distributed. Hereupon imagine Cato hurrying to the
                                                  rostra, delivering an admirable invective against
                                                  the consul, if we can call that an ''invective""
                                                  which was really a speech of the utmost weight and

                                                  delivered some wretched speeches to the people, in

                                                  There is the state of things at,Rome,for you. Yet
                                                  pray listen to this one thing more which has
                                                  surpassed my hopes. Messalla is a superlatively
                                                  good consul, courageous, firm, painstaking; he
                                                  praises, shows attachment to, and imitates me.
                                                  That other one (Piso) is the less mischievous
                                                  because of one vice—he is lazy, sleepy,
                                                  unbusinesslike, an utter fainéant, but in intention
                                                  he is so disaffected that he has begun to loathe
                                                  Pompey since he made the speech in which some
                                                  praise was bestowed on the senate. Accordingly, he
                                                  has alienated all the loyalists to a remarkable
                                                  degree. And his action is not dictated by love for
                                                  Clodius more than by a taste for a profligate
                                                  policy and a profligate party. But he has nobody
                                                  among the magistrates like himself, with the
                                                  single exception of the tribune Fufius. The

                                                  how I came to make a worse fight of it than usual.
                                                  I will answer the last first. after the manner of

                                                  battled with such gallantry and vigour that there
                                                  were shouts of applause and crowds round me in the
                                                  house ringing with my praise. Nay, if you ever
                                                  thought that I showed courage in political
                                                  business, you certainly would have admired my
                                                  conduct in that cause. For when the culprit had
                                                  betaken himself to public meetings, and had made
                                                  an invidious use of my name, immortal gods! What

                                                  Piso, Curio, on the whole of that set! How I fell

                                                  young for their profligacy! Again and again, so

                                                  as the supporter of my policy, but as the
                                                  spectator also of my admirable fighting. However,
                                                  when Hortensius hit on the idea of a law as to the
                                                  sacrilege being proposed by the tribune Fufius, in
                                                  which there was no difference from the bill of the
                                                  consul except as to the kind of
                                                  jurymen—on that point, however, the
                                                  whole question turned—and got it carried
                                                  by sheer fighting, because he had persuaded
                                                  himself and others that he could not get an
                                                  acquittal no matter who were the jurymen, I drew
                                                  in my sails, seeing the neediness of the jurors,
                                                  and gave no evidence beyond what was so notorious
                                                  and well attested that I could not omit it.,insert_note_343,31,Therefore, if you ask  reason
                                                  of the acquittal—to return at length to
                                                  the former of the two questions —it was
                                                  entirely the poverty and low character of the
                                                  jury. But that this was possible was entirely the
                                                  result of Hortensius's policy. In his alarm lest
                                                  Fufius should veto the law which was to be
                                                  proposed in virtue of a senatorial decree, he
                                                  failed to see that it was better that the culprit
                                                  should be left under a cloud of disgrace and
                                                  dishonour than that he should be trusted to the
                                                  discretion of a weak jury. But in his passionate
                                                  resentment he hastened to bring the case into
                                                  court, saying that a leaden sword was good enough
                                                  to cut his throat. But if you want to know the
                                                  history of the trial, with its incredible verdict,
                                                  it was such that Hortensius's policy is now blamed
                                                  by other people after the event, though I
                                                  disapproved of it from the first. When the
                                                  rejection of jurors had taken place, amidst loud
                                                  cheers and counter-cheers—the accuser
                                                  like a strict censor rejecting the most worthless,
                                                  the defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of
                                                  gladiators all the best—as soon as the
                                                  jury had taken their seats, the loyalists at once
                                                  began to feel distrust. There never was a seedier

                                                  under a cloud, equites out at elbows, tribunes who
                                                  were not so much made of money as ""collectors"" of

                                                  honest men in the panel, whom he had been unable
                                                  to drive off it by rejection, and they took their
                                                  seats among their uncongenial comrades with gloomy
                                                  looks and signs of emotion, and were keenly
                                                  disgusted at having to rub elbows with such
                                                  rascals. Hereupon, as question after question was
                                                  referred to the panel in the preliminary
                                                  proceedings, the severity of the decisions passes
                                                  belief: there was no disagreement in 
                                                  voting, the defendant carried none of his points,
                                                  while the accuser got even more than he asked. He
                                                  was triumphant. Need I say more? Hortensius would
                                                  have it that he was the only one of us who had
                                                  seen the truth. There was not a man who did not
                                                  think it impossible for him to stand his trial
                                                  without being condemned a thousand times over.
                                                  Further, when I was produced as a witness, I
                                                  suppose you have been told how the shouts of
                                                  Clodius's supporters were answered by the jury
                                                  rising to their feet to gather round me, and
                                                  openly to offer their throats to P. Clodius in my
                                                  defence. This seemed to me a greater compliment
                                                  than the well-known occasion when your fellow
                                                  citizens,insert_note_351,33,stopped Xenocrates from taking an oath in
                                                  the witness-box, or when, upon the accounts of
                                                  Metellus Numidicus,insert_note_355,34,being as usual handed
                                                  round, a Roman jury refused to look at them. The
                                                  compliment paid me, I repeat, was much greater.
                                                  Accordingly, as the jurymen were protecting me as
                                                  the mainstay of the country, it was by their
                                                  voices that the defendant was overwhelmed, and
                                                  with him all his advocates suffered a crushing
                                                  blow. Next day my house was visited by as great a
                                                  throng as that which escorted me home when I laid
                                                  down the consulship. Our eminent Areopagites then
                                                  exclaimed that they would not come into court
                                                  unless a guard was assigned them. The question was
                                                  put to the whole panel: there was only one vote
                                                  against the need of a guard. The question is
                                                  brought before the senate: the decree is passed in
                                                  the most solemn and laudatory terms : the jurymen
                                                  are complimented: the magistrates are commissioned
                                                  to carry it out: no one thought that the fellow
                                                  would venture on a defence. ""Tell me, ye Muses,

                                                  already mentioned to you in a letter. In two days'
                                                  time, by the agency of a single slave, and one,
                                                  too, from a school of gladiators, he settled the
                                                  whole business—he summoned them to an
                                                  interview, made a promise, offered security, paid
                                                  money down. Still farther, good heavens, what a
                                                  scandal! even favours from certain ladies, and
                                                  introductions to young men of rank, were thrown in
                                                  as a kind of pourboire to some of the jurors.
                                                  Accordingly, with the loyalists holding completely
                                                  aloof, with the forum full of slaves, twenty-five
                                                  jurors were yet found so courageous that, though
                                                  at the risk of their lives, they preferred even
                                                  death to producing universal ruin. There were
                                                  thirty-one who were more influenced by famine than
                                                  fame. On seeing one of these latter Catulus said
                                                  to him, ""Why did you ask us for a guard? Did you
                                                  fear being robbed of the money?"" There you have,

                                                  and the influence of my consulship—that

                                                  However, to console you as to the state of the
                                                  Republic, rascaldom is not as cheerful and
                                                  exultant in its victory as the disloyal hoped
                                                  after the infliction of such a wound upon the
                                                  Republic. For they fully expected that when

                                                  lust would openly exact vengeance from  all the best men for the mortification which
                                                  the strictness of my consulship had branded in
                                                  upon all the worst. And it is once more

                                                  loyalists, cheering and encouraging each
                                                  personally. Moreover, by my denunciations and
                                                  invectives against those corrupt jurors I left

                                                  victory a word to say for themselves. I gave the

                                                  to its former severity. I overwhelmed Clodius in

                                                  weighty and serious, and also in an interchange of
                                                  repartees, of which I append a specimen for your

                                                  opinion, I spoke at considerable length on the
                                                  high interests of the Republic, and brought in the
                                                  following passage by a happy inspiration: ""Do not,

                                                  yet feel sure should not be regarded with extreme

                                                  jurors upon the Republic. You are mistaken,
                                                  Clodius: it is not for the city but for the prison
                                                  that the jurors have reserved you, and their
                                                  intention was not to retain you in the state, but
                                                  to deprive you of the privilege of exile.
                                                  Wherefore, Fathers, rouse up all your courage,
                                                  hold fast to your high calling. There still
                                                  remains in the Republic the old unanimity of the
                                                  loyalists: their feelings have been outraged,
                                                  their resolution has not been weakened: no fresh
                                                  mischief has been done, only what was actually
                                                  existing has been discovered. In the trial of one
                                                  profligate many like him have been
                                                  detected.""—But what am I about? I have
                                                  copied almost a speech into a letter. I return to
                                                  the duel of words. Up gets our dandified young  gentleman, and throws in my teeth my

                                                  that matter to him? ""It is as though you were to

                                                  up with this king?"" ""Do you mention a king,"" quoth

                                                  He, you know, had swallowed the inheritance of Rex
                                                  in anticipation. ""You have bought a house,"" says
                                                  he. ""You would think that he said,"" quoth I, ""you
                                                  have bought a jury."" ""They didn't trust you on
                                                  your oath,"" said he. ""Yes,"" said I, ""twenty-five

                                                  for they took care to get their money beforehand.""
                                                  Here he was overpowered by a burst of applause and
                                                  broke down without a word to say.,My own position is this: with the
                                                  loyalists I hold the same place as when you left
                                                  town, with the tagrag and bobtail of the City I
                                                  hold a much better one than at your departure. For
                                                  it does me no harm that my evidence appears not to
                                                  have availed. Envy has been let blood without
                                                  causing pain, and even more so from the fact that
                                                  all the supporters of that flagitious proceeding
                                                  confess that a perfectly notorious fact has been
                                                  hushed up by bribing the jury. Besides, the
                                                  wretched starveling mob, the blood-sucker of the
                                                  treasury, imagines me to be high in the favour of
                                                  Magnus—and indeed we have been mutually
                                                  united by frequent pleasant intercourse to such an
                                                  extent, that our friends the boon companions of
                                                  the conspiracy, the young chin-tufts, speak of him
                                                  in ordinary conversation as Gnaeus Cicero.
                                                  Accordingly, both in the circus and at the
                                                  gladiatorial games, I received a remarkable
                                                  ovation without a single cat-call. There is at
                                                  present a lively anticipation of the elections, in
                                                  which, contrary to everybody's wishes, our friend
                                                  Magnus is pushing the claims of Aulus's son;,insert_note_395,39,and in
                                                  that matter his weapons are  neither
                                                  his prestige nor his popularity, but those by
                                                  which Philip said that any fortress could be
                                                  taken—if only an ass laden with gold
                                                  could make its way up into it. Furthermore, that
                                                  precious consul, playing as it were second fiddle
                                                  to Pompey,,insert_note_399,40,is said to have undertaken the business
                                                  and to have bribery agents at his house, which I
                                                  don't believe. But two decrees have already passed
                                                  the house of an unpopular character, because they
                                                  are thought to be directed against the consul on
                                                  the demand of Cato and Domitius,insert_note_403,41,—one that
                                                  search should be allowed in magistrates' houses,
                                                  and a second, that all who had bribery agents in
                                                  their houses were guilty of treason. The tribune
                                                  Lurco also, having entered on his office
                                                  irregularly in view of the Aelian law, has been
                                                  relieved from the provisions both of the Aelian
                                                  and Fufian laws, in order to enable him to propose
                                                  his law on bribery, which he promulgated with
                                                  correct auspices though a cripple.,insert_note_407,42,Accordingly, the,comitia,have been postponed to
                                                  the 27th of July. There is this novelty in his
                                                  bill, that a man who has promised money among the
                                                  tribes, but not paid it, is not liable, but, if he
                                                  has paid, he is liable for life to pay 3,000
                                                  sesterces to each tribe. I remarked that P.
                                                  Clodius had obeyed this law by anticipation, for
                                                  he was accustomed to promise, and not pay. But
                                                  observe! Don't you see that the consulship of
                                                  which we thought so much, which Curio used of old
                                                  to call an apotheosis, if this Afranius is
                                                  elected, will become a mere farce and mockery?
                                                  Therefore I think one should play the philosopher,
                                                  as you in fact do, and not care a straw for your

                                                  my part I should have preferred your going, and I
                                                  fear that there may be some offence,insert_note_421,43,given in that matter.
                                                  Nevertheless, I am not the man to blame you,

                                                  deep offence, or such an extraordinary change of
                                                  feeling. And yet I was already aware, as I saw
                                                  that you also, when you took leave of me, were
                                                  beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking
                                                  dissatisfaction, that his feelings were wounded,
                                                  and that certain unfriendly suspicions had sunk
                                                  deep into his heart. On trying on several previous
                                                  occasions, but more eagerly than ever after the
                                                  allotment of his province, to assuage these
                                                  feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand
                                                  that the extent of his offence was so great as
                                                  your letter indicates; but on the other I did not
                                                  make as much progress in allaying it as I wished.
                                                  However, I consoled myself with thinking that
                                                  there would be no doubt of his seeing you at,Dyrrachium,, or somewhere in your part
                                                  of the country: and, if that happened, I felt sure
                                                  and fully persuaded that everything would be made
                                                  smooth between you, not only by conversation and
                                                  mutual explanation, but by the very sight of each
                                                  other in such an interview. For I need not say in
                                                  writing to you, who know it quite well, how kind
                                                  and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to
                                                  forgive as he is sensitive in taking offence. But
                                                  it most unfortunately happened that you did not
                                                  see him anywhere. For the impression he had
                                                  received from the artifices of  others
                                                  had more weight with him than duty or
                                                  relationship, or the old affection so long
                                                  existing between you, which ought to have been the
                                                  strongest influence of all. And yet, as to where
                                                  the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can
                                                  more easily conceive than write: since I am afraid
                                                  that, while defending my own relations, I should
                                                  not spare yours. For I perceive that, though no
                                                  actual wound was inflicted by members of the
                                                  family, they yet could at least have cured it. But
                                                  the root of the mischief in this case, which
                                                  perhaps extends farther than appears, I shall more
                                                  conveniently explain to you when we meet. As to
                                                  the letter he sent to you from,Thessalonica,,,insert_note_471,48,and about the language which you suppose
                                                  him to have used both at,Rome,among your
                                                  friends and on his journey, I don't know how far
                                                  the matter went, but my whole hope of removing
                                                  this unpleasantness rests on your kindness. For if
                                                  you will only make up your mind to believe that
                                                  the best men are often those whose feelings are
                                                  most easily irritated and appeased, and that this
                                                  quickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of
                                                  disposition are generally signs of a good heart
                                                  and lastly—and this is the main
                                                  thing—that we must mutually put up with
                                                  each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?), or
                                                  faults, or injurious acts, then these
                                                  misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed
                                                  away. I beg you to take this view, for it is the
                                                  dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one
                                                  else's can be) that there should not be one of my
                                                  family or friends who does not love you and is not
                                                  loved by you.,That part of
                                                  your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you
                                                  mention what opportunities of doing good business
                                                  in the provinces or the city you let pass at other
                                                  times as well as in the year of my consulship: for
                                                  I am thoroughly persuaded of your unselfishness
                                                  and magnanimity, nor did I ever think that there
                                                  was any difference between you and me except in
                                                  our choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek
                                                  official advancement, while another and perfectly
                                                  laudable resolution led you to seek an honourable
                                                  privacy. In the true glory, which is founded on
                                                  honesty, industry, and piety, I place neither
                                                  myself nor anyone else above you. In affection
                                                  towards myself, next to my brother 
                                                  and immediate family, I put you first. For indeed,
                                                  indeed I have seen and thoroughly appreciated how
                                                  your anxiety and joy have corresponded with the
                                                  variations of my fortunes. Often has your
                                                  congratulation added a charm to praise, and your
                                                  consolation a welcome antidote to alarm. Nay, at
                                                  this moment of your absence, it is not only your
                                                  advice—in which you excel—but
                                                  the interchange of speech—in which no
                                                  one gives me so much delight as you
                                                  do—that I miss most, shall I say in
                                                  politics, in which circumspection is always
                                                  incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I
                                                  formerly sustained with a view to official
                                                  promotion, and nowadays to maintain my position by
                                                  securing popularity, or in the mere business of my
                                                  family? In all these I missed you and our
                                                  conversations before my brother left,Rome,, and still
                                                  more do I miss them since. Finally, neither my
                                                  work nor rest, neither my business nor leisure,
                                                  neither my affairs in the forum or at home, public
                                                  or private, can any longer do without your most
                                                  consolatory and affectionate counsel and
                                                  conversation. The modest reserve which
                                                  characterizes both of us has often prevented my
                                                  mentioning these facts; but on this occasion it
                                                  was rendered necessary by that part of your letter
                                                  in which you expressed a wish to have yourself and
                                                  your character ""put straight"" and ""cleared"" in my
                                                  eyes. Yet, in the midst of all this unfortunate
                                                  alienation and anger, there is one fortunate
                                                  circumstance—that your determination of
                                                  not going to a province was known to me and your
                                                  other friends, and had been at various times
                                                  before distinctly expressed by yourself; so that
                                                  your not being his guest may be attributed to your
                                                  personal tastes and judgments, not to the quarrel
                                                  and rupture between you. And so those ties which
                                                  have been broken will be restored, and ours which
                                                  have been so religiously preserved will retain all
                                                  their old inviolability.,At,Rome,I find politics in a shaky
                                                  condition; everything is unsatisfactory and
                                                  foreboding change. For I have no doubt you have
                                                  been told that our friends, the equites, are all
                                                  but alienated from the senate. Their first
                                                  grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the
                                                  authority of the senate for the trial of such as
                                                  had taken bribes for giving a verdict. I happened
                                                  not to be in the house when that decree was
                                                  passed, but when I found that the equestrian order
                                                  was indignant at it, and yet refrained from openly
                                                  saying so, I  remonstrated with the
                                                  senate, as I thought, in very impressive language,
                                                  and was very weighty and eloquent considering the
                                                  unsatisfactory nature of my cause. But here is
                                                  another piece of almost intolerable coolness on
                                                  the part of the equites, which I have not only
                                                  submitted to, but have even put in as good a light
                                                  as possible! The companies which had contracted
                                                  with the censors for,Asia,complained that in the heat of
                                                  the competition they had taken the contract at an
                                                  excessive price; they demanded that the contract
                                                  should be annulled. I led in their support, or
                                                  rather, I was second, for it was Crassus who
                                                  induced them to venture on this demand. The case
                                                  is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a
                                                  confession of rash speculation. Yet there was a
                                                  very great risk that, if they got no concession,
                                                  they would be completely alienated from the
                                                  senate. Here again I came to the rescue more than
                                                  anyone else, and secured them a full and very
                                                  friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of
                                                  December, delivered long speeches on the dignity
                                                  and harmony of the two orders. The business is not
                                                  yet settled, but the favourable feeling of the
                                                  senate has been made manifest: for no one had
                                                  spoken against it except the consul-designate,
                                                  Metellus; while our hero Cato had still to speak,
                                                  the shortness of the day having prevented his turn
                                                  being reached. Thus I, in the maintenance of my
                                                  steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability
                                                  that harmony of the orders which was originally my
                                                  joiner's work; but since it all now seems in such

                                                  a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe
                                                  to you in a letter, but of which I will
                                                  nevertheless give you a hint. I cultivate close
                                                  intimacy with Pompey. I foresee what you will say.
                                                  I will use all necessary precautions, and I will

                    neither hoped for that, nor did I well see how it was possible; but in order
                    that if anything  happened to me, (and many things appeared to be
                    threatening me out of the regular course of nature, and even of destiny,) I
                    might still leave my speech on this day as a witness to the republic of my
                    everlasting attachment to its interests.,,"
M. Tullius Cicero,Letters,,"B.C. 60. coss., Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer, L. Afranius. B.C. 60. coss., Q. Caecilius Metellus Celer, L. Afranius. This was the year in which Caesar, returning from his propraetorship in Spain , found Pompey in difficulties with the senate (1) as to the confirmation en bloc of his acta in the East, (2) as to the assignation of lands to his veterans; and being met with opposition himself as to the triumph that he claimed, and his candidatureship for the consulship, he formed with Pompey and Crassus the agreement known as the first triumvirate. Cicero saw his favourite political object, the concordia ordinum , threatened by any opposition to the triumvirate, which he yet distrusted as dangerous to the constitution. We shall find him, therefore, vacillating between giving his support to its policy or standing by the extreme Optimates. P. Clodius is taking measures to be adopted into a plebeian gens, in order to stand for the tribuneship. Quintus is still in Asia . Pompey's triumph had taken place in the previous September. XXIII (A I, 18) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 20 JANUARY Believe me there is nothing at this moment of which I stand so much in need as a man with whom to share all that causes me anxiety: a man to love me; a man of sense to whom I can speak without affectation, reserve, or concealment. For my brother is away—that most open-hearted and affectionate of men. Metellus is not a human being, but “ Mere sound and air, a howling wilderness. ” While you, who have so often lightened my anxiety and my anguish of soul by your conversation and advice, who are ever my ally in public affairs, my confidant in all private business, the sharer in all my conversations and projects—where are you? So entirely am I abandoned by all, that the only moments of repose left me are those which are spent with my wife, pet daughter, and sweet little Cicero. For as to those friendships with the great, and their artificial attractions, they have indeed a certain glitter in the outside world, but they bring no private satisfaction. And so, after a crowded morning levée, as I go down to the forum surrounded by troops of friends, I can find no one out of all that crowd with whom to jest freely, or into whose ear I can breathe a familiar sigh. Therefore I wait for you, I long for you, I even urge on you to come for I have many anxieties, many pressing cares, of which I think, if I once had your ears to listen to me, I could unburden myself in the conversation of a single walk. And of my private anxieties, indeed, I shall conceal all the stings and vexations, and not trust them to this letter and an unknown letter-carrier. These, however—for I don't want you to be made too anxious—are not very painful: yet they are persistent and worrying, and are not put to rest by the advice or conversation of any friend. But in regard to the Republic I have still the same courage and purpose, though it has again and again of its own act eluded treatment. 1 For should I put briefly what has occurred since you left, you would certainly exclaim that the Roman empire cannot be maintained much longer. Well, after your departure our first scene, I think, was the appearance of the Clodian scandal, in which having, as I thought, got an opportunity of pruning licentiousness and keeping our young men within bounds, I exerted myself to the utmost, and lavished all the resources of my intellect and genius, not from dislike to an individual, but from the hope of not merely correcting, but of completely curing the state. The Republic received a crushing blow when this jury was won over by money and the opportunity of debauchery. See what has followed we have had a consul inflicted upon us, whom none except us philosophers can look at without a sigh. What a blow that is ! Though a decree of the senate has been passed about bribery and the corruption of juries, no law has been carried; the senate has been harassed to death, the Roman knights alienated. So that one year has undermined two buttresses of the Republic, which owed their existence to me, and me alone; for it has at once destroyed the prestige of the senate and broken up the harmony of the orders. And now enter this precious year! It was inaugurated by the suspension of the annual rites of Iuventas ; 2 for Memmius initiated M. Lucullus's wife in some rites of his own! Our Menelaus, being annoyed at that, divorced his wife. Yet the old Idaean shepherd had only injured Menelaus; our Roman Paris thought Agamemnon as proper an object of injury as Menelaus. 3 Next there is a certain tribune named C. Herennius, whom you, perhaps, do not even know—and yet you may know him, for he is of your tribe, and his father Sextus used to distribute money to your tribesmen—this person is trying to transfer P. Clodius to the plebs, and is actually proposing a law to authorize the whole people to vote in Clodius's affair in the campus . 4 I have given him a characteristic reception in the senate, but he is the thickest-skinned fellow in the world. Metellus is an excellent consul, and much attached to me, but he has lowered his influence by promulgating (though only for form's sake) an identical bill about Clodius. But the son of Aulus, 5 God in heaven! What a cowardly and spiritless fellow for a soldier! How well he deserves to be exposed, as he is, day after day to the abuse of Palicanus ! 6 Farther, an agrarian law has been promulgated by Flavius, a poor production enough, almost identical with that of Plotius. But meanwhile a genuine statesman is not to be found, even in a dream. The man who could be one, my friend Pompey—for such he is, as I would have you know—defends his two penny embroidered toga 7 by saying nothing. Crassus never risks his popularity by a word. The others you know without my telling you. They are such fools that they seem to expect that, though the Republic is lost, their fish-ponds will be safe. There is one man who does take some trouble, but rather, as it seems to me, with consistency and honesty, than with either prudence or ability— Cato . He has been for the last three months worrying those unhappy publicani , who were formerly devoted to him, and refuses to allow of an answer being given them by the senate. And so we are forced to suspend all decrees on other subjects until the publicani have got their answer. For the same reason I suppose even the business of the foreign embassies will be postponed. You now understand in what stormy water we are and as from what I have written to you in such strong terms you have a view also of what I have not written, come back to me, for it is time you did. And though the state of affairs to which I invite you is one to be avoided, yet let your value for me so far prevail, as to induce you to come there even in these vexatious circumstances. For the rest I will take care that due warning is given, and a notice put up in all places, to prevent you being entered on the census as absent; and to get put on the census just before the lustration is the mark of your true man of business. 8 So let me see you at the earliest possible moment. Farewell. 20 January in the Consulship of Q. Metellus and L. Afranius. XXIV (A I, 19) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 15 MARCH It is not only if I had as much leisure as you, but also if I chose to send letters as short as yours usually are, should I easily beat you and be much the more regular in writing. But, in fact, it is only one more item in an immense and inconceivable amount of business, that I allow no letter to reach you from me without its containing some definite sketch of events and the reflections arising from it. And in writing to you, as a lover of your country, my first subject will naturally be the state of the republic; next, as I am the nearest object of your affection, I will also write about myself, and tell you what I think you will not be indisposed to know. Well then, in public affairs for the moment the chief subject of interest is the disturbance in Gaul . For the Aedui— our brethren 9 —have recently fought a losing battle, and the Helvetii are undoubtedly in arms and making raids upon our province. 10 The senate has decreed that the two Consuls should draw lots for the Gauls, that a levy should be held, all exemptions from service be suspended, and legates with full powers be sent to visit the states in Gaul , and see that they do not join the Helvetii. The legates are Quintus Metellus Creticus, 11 L. Flaccus, 12 and lastly—a case of rich unguent on lentils —Lentulus, son of Clodianus. 13 And while on this subject I cannot omit mentioning that when among the consulars my name was the first to come up in the ballot, a full meeting of the senate declared with one voice that I must be kept in the city. The same occurred to Pompey after me; so that we two appeared to be kept at home as pledges of the safety of the Republic. Why should I look for the bravos of others when I get these compliments at home? Well, the state of affairs in the city is as follows. The agrarian law is being vehemently pushed by the tribune Flavius, with the support of Pompey, but it has nothing popular about it except its supporter. From this law I, with the full assent of a public meeting, proposed to omit all clauses which adversely affected private rights. I proposed to except from its operation such public land as had been so in the consulship of P. Mucius and L. Calpurnius. 14 I proposed to confirm the titles of holders of those to whom Sulla had actually assigned lands. I proposed to retain the men of Volaterrae and Arretium—whose lands Sulla had declared forfeited but had not allotted—in their holdings. There was only one section in the bill that I did not propose to omit, namely, that land should be purchased with this money from abroad, the proceeds of the new revenues for the next five years. 15 But to this whole agrarian scheme the senate was opposed, suspecting that some novel power for Pompey was aimed at. Pompey, indeed, had set his heart on getting the law passed. I, however, with the full approval of the applicants for land, maintained the holdings of all private owners—for, as you know, the landed gentry form the bulk of our party's forces—while I nevertheless satisfied the people and Pompey (for I wanted to do that also) by the purchase clause; for, if that was put on a sound footing, I thought that two advantages would accrue—the dregs might be drawn from the city, and the deserted portions of Italy be repeopled. But this whole business was interrupted by the war, and has cooled off. Metellus is an exceedingly good consul, and much attached to me. That other one is such a ninny that he clearly doesn't know what to do with his purchase. 16 This is all my public news, unless you regard as touching on public affairs the fact that a certain Herennius, a tribune, and a fellow tribesman of yours—a fellow as unprincipled as he is needy—has now begun making frequent proposals for transferring P. Clodius to the plebs; he is vetoed by many of his colleagues. That is really, I think, all the public news. For my part, ever since I won what I may call the splendid and immortal glory of the famous fifth of December 17 (though it was accompanied by the jealousy and hostility of many), I have never ceased to play my part in the Republic in the same lofty spirit, and to maintain the position I then inaugurated and took upon myself. But when, first, by the acquittal of Clodius I clearly perceived the insecurity and rotten state of the law courts; and, secondly, when I saw that it took so little to alienate my friends the publicani from the senate—though with me personally they had no quarrel; and, thirdly, that the rich (I mean your friends the fish-breeders) did not disguise their jealousy of me, I thought I must look out for some greater security and stronger support. So, to begin with, I have brought the man who had been too long silent on my achievements, Pompey himself, to such a frame of mind as not once only in the senate, but many times and in many words, to ascribe to me the preservation of this empire and of the world. And this was not so important to me—for those transactions are neither so obscure as to need and Pompey from a difference of opinion on these measures. testimony, nor so dubious as to need commendation—as to the Republic; for there were certain persons base enough to think that some misunderstanding would arise between me with him I have united myself in such close intimacy that both of us can by this union be better fortified in his own views, and more secure in his political position. However, the dislike of the licentious dandies, which had been roused against me, has been so far softened by a Conciliatory manner on my part, that they all combine to show me marked attention. In fine, while avoiding churlishness to anyone, I do not curry favour with the populace or relax any principle; but my whole course of conduct is so carefully regulated, that, while exhibiting an example of firmness to the Republic, in my own private concerns—in view of the instability of the loyalists, the hostility of the disaffected, and the hatred of the disloyal towards me—I employ a certain caution and circumspection, and do not allow myself, after all, to be involved in these new friendships so far but that the famous refrain of the cunning Sicilian frequently sounds in my ears: 18 “ Keep sober and distrust these wisdom's sinews! ” Of my course and way of life, therefore, you see, I think, what may be called a sketch or outline. Of your own business, however, you frequently write to me, but I cannot at the moment supply the remedy you require. For that decree of the senate was passed with the greatest unanimity on the part of the rank and file, 19 though without the support of any of us consulars. For as to your seeing my name at the foot of the decree, you can ascertain from the decree itself that the subject put to the vote at the time was a different one, and that this clause about free peoples was added without good reason. It was done by P. Servilius the younger, 20 who delivered his vote among the last, but it cannot be altered after such an interval of time. Accordingly, the meetings, which at first were crowded, have long ceased to be held. If you have been able, notwithstanding, by your insinuating address to get a trifle of money out of the Sicyonians, I wish you would let me know. 21 I have sent you an account of my consulship written in Greek. If there is anything in it which to a genuine Attic like yourself seems to be un-Greek or unscholarly, I shall not say as Lucullus said to you (at Panhormus , was it not?) about his own history, that he had interspersed certain barbarisms and solecisms for the express purpose of proving that it was the work of a Roman. No, if there is anything of that sort in my book, it will be without my knowledge and against my will. When I have finished the Latin version I will send it to you; and thirdly, you may expect a poem on the subject, for I would not have any method of celebrating my praise omitted by myself. In this regard pray do not quote Who will praise his sire? 22 For if there is anything in the world to be preferred to this, let it receive its due meed of praise, and I mine of blame for not selecting another theme for my praise. However, what I write is not panegyric but history. My brother Quintus clears himself to me in a letter, and asserts that he has never said a disparaging word of you to anyone. But this we must discuss face to face with the greatest care and earnestness: only do come to see me again at last! This Cossinius, to whom I intrust my letter, seems to me a very good fellow, steady, devoted to you, and exactly the sort of man which your letter to me had described. 15 March. XXV (A I, 20) TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) ROME , 13 MAY On my return to Rome from my villa at Pompeii on the 12th of May, our friend Cincius handed me your letter dated 13th February. It is this letter of yours which I will now proceed to answer. And first let me say how glad I am that you have fully understood my appreciation of you; 23 and next how excessively rejoiced I am that you have been so extremely reasonable in regard to those particulars in which you thought 24 that I and mine had behaved unkindly, or with insufficient consideration for your feelings: and this I regard as a proof of no common affection, and of the most excellent judgment and wisdom. Wherefore, since you have written to me in a tone so delightful, considerate, friendly and kind, that I not only have no call to press you any farther, but can never even hope to meet from you or any other man with so much gentleness and good nature, I think the very best course I can pursue is not to say another word on the subject in my letters. When we meet, if the occasion should arise, we will discuss it together. As to what you say about politics, your suggestions indeed are both affectionate and wise, and the course you suggest does not differ substantially from my own policy—for I must neither budge an inch from the position imposed upon me by my rank, nor must I without forces of my own enter the lines of another, while that other, whom you mention in your letter, has nothing large-minded about him, nothing lofty, —nothing which is not abject and time-serving. However, the course I took was, after all, perhaps not ill-calculated for securing the tranquillity of my own life; but, by heaven, I did greater service to the Republic than, by suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, I did to myself, when I brought conviction home to the wavering mind of a man of the most splendid fortune, influence and popularity, and induced him to disappoint the disloyal and praise my acts. Now if I had been forced to sacrifice consistency in this transaction, I should not have thought anything worth that price; but the fact is that I have so worked the whole business, that I did not seem to be less consistent from my complacency to him, but that he appeared to gain in character by his approbation of me. In everything else I am so acting, and shall continue so to act, as to prevent my seeming to have done what I did do by mere chance. My friends the loyalists, the men at whom you hint, and that Sparta which you say has fallen to my lot, 25 I will not only never desert, but even if I am deserted by her, I shall still stand by my ancient creed. However, please consider this, that since the death of Catulus I am holding this road for the loyalists without any garrison or Company. For as Rhinton, I think, says: “ Some are stark naught, and some care not at all. ” 26 However, how our friends the fish-breeders 27 envy me I will write you word another time, or will reserve it till we meet. But from the senate-house nothing shall ever tear me: either because that course is the right one, or because it is most to my interests, or because I am far from being dissatisfied with the estimation in which I am held by the senate. As to the Sicyonians, as I wrote to you before, 28 there is not much to be hoped for in the senate. For there is no one now to lay a complaint before it. Therefore, if you are waiting for that, you will find it a tedious business. Fight some other way if you can. At the time the decree was passed no one noticed who would be affected by it, and besides the rank and file of the senators voted in a great hurry for that clause. For cancelling the senatorial decree the time is not yet ripe, because there are none to complain of it, and because also many are glad to have it so, some from spite, some from a notion of its equity. Your friend Metellus is an admirable consul: I have only one fault to find with him—he doesn't receive the news from Gaul of the restoration of peace with much pleasure. He wants a triumph, I suppose. I could have wished a little less of that sort of thing: in other respects he is splendid. But the son of Aulus behaves in such a way, that his consulship is not a consulship but a stigma on our friend Magnus. Of my writings I send you my consulship in Greek completed. I have handed that book to L. Cossinius. My Latin works I think you like, but as a Greek you envy this Greek book. If others write treatises on the subject I will send them to you, but I assure you that, as soon as they have read mine, somehow or other they become slack. To return to my own affairs, L. Papirius Paetus, an excellent man and an admirer of mine, has presented me with the books left him by Servius Claudius. As your friend Cincius told me that I could take them without breaking the lex Cincia , 29 I told him that I should have great pleasure in accepting them, if he brought them to Italy . Wherefore, as you love me, as you know that I love you, do try by means of friends, clients, guests, or even your freedmen or slaves, to prevent the loss of a single leaf. For I am in urgent need of the Greek books which I suspect, and of the Latin books which I know, that he left: and more and more every day I find repose in such studies every moment left to me from my labours in the forum. You will, I say, do me a very great favour, if you will be as zealous in this matter as you ever are in matters in which you suppose me to feel strongly; and Paetus's own affairs I recommend to your kindness, for which he thanks you extremely. A prompt visit from yourself is a thing which I do not merely ask for, I advise it. XXVI (A II, 1) TO ATTICUS (IN GREECE) ROME , JUNE On the 1st of June, as I was on my way to Antium , and eagerly getting out of the way of M. Metellus's gladiators, your boy met me, and delivered to me a letter from you and a history of my consulship written in Greek. 30 This made me glad that I had some time before delivered to L. Cossinius a book, also written in Greek, on the same subject, to take to you. For if I had read yours first you might have said that I had pilfered from you. Although your essay (which I have read with pleasure) seemed to me just a trifle rough and bald, yet its very neglect of ornament is an ornament in itself, as women were once thought to have the best perfume who used none. My book, on the other hand, has exhausted the whole of Isocrates's unguent case, and all the paint-boxes of his pupils, and even Aristotle's colours. This, as you tell me in another letter, you glanced over at Corcyra , and afterwards I suppose received it from Cossinius. 31 I should not have ventured to send it to you until I had slowly and fastidiously revised it. However, Posidonius, in his letter of acknowledgment from Rhodes , says that as he read my memoir, which I had sent him with a view to his writing on the same subject with more elaboration, he was not only not incited to write, but absolutely made afraid to do so. In a word, I have routed the Greeks. Accordingly, as a general rule, those who were pressing me for material to work up, have now ceased to bother me. Pray, if you like the book, see to there being copies at Athens and other Greek towns 32 for it may possibly throw some lustre on my actions. As for my poor speeches, I will send you both those you ask for and some more also, since what I write to satisfy the studious youth finds favour, it seems, with you also. [For it suited my purpose 33 —both because it was in his Philippics that your fellow citizen Demosthenes gained his reputation, and because it was by withdrawing from the mere controversial and forensic style of oratory that he acquired the character of a serious politician—to see that I too should have speeches that may properly be called consular . Of these are, first, one delivered on the 1st of January in the senate, a second to the people on the agrarian law, a third on Otho, a fourth for Rabirius, a fifth on the Sons of the Proscribed, a sixth when I declined a province in public meeting, a seventh when I allowed Catiline to escape, which I delivered the day after Catiline fled, a ninth in public meeting on the day that the Allobroges made their revelation, a tenth in the senate on the 5th of December. There are also two short ones, which may be called fragments, on the agrarian law. This whole cycle I will see that you have. And since you like my writings as well as my actions, from these same rolls you will learn both what I have done and what I have said—or you should not have asked for them, for I did not make you an offer of them.] You ask me why I urge you to come home, and at the same time you intimate that you are hampered by business affairs, and yet say that you will nevertheless hasten back, not only if it is needful, but even if I desire it. Well, there is certainly no absolute necessity, yet I do think you might plan the periods of your tour somewhat more conveniently. Your absence is too prolonged, especially as you are in a neighbouring country, while yet I cannot enjoy your society, nor you mine. For the present there is peace, but if my young friend Puncher's 34 madness found means to advance a little farther, I should certainly summon you from your present sojourn. But Metellus is offering him a splendid opposition and will continue to do so. Need I say more? He is a truly patriotic consul and, as I have ever thought, naturally an honest man. That person, however, makes no disguise, but avowedly desires to be elected tribune. But when the matter was mooted in the senate, I cut the fellow to pieces, and taunted him with his changeableness in seeking the tribuneship at Rome after having given out at Hera, in Sicily , 35 that he was a candidate for the aedileship; and went on to say that we needn't much trouble ourselves, for that he would not be permitted to ruin the Republic any more as a plebeian, than patricians like him had been allowed to do so in my consulship. Presently, on his saying that he had completed the journey from the straits in seven days, and that it was impossible for anyone to have gone out to meet him, and that he had entered the city by night, 36 and making a great parade of this in a public meeting, I remarked that that was nothing new for him: seven days from Sicily to Rome , three hours from Rome to lnteramna ! 37 Entered by night, did he? so he did before! No one went to meet him? neither did anyone on the other occasion, exactly when it should have been done! In short, I bring our young upstart to his bearings, not only by a set and serious speech, but also by repartees of this sort. Accordingly, I have come now to rally him and jest with him in quite a familiar manner. For instance, when we were escorting a candidate, he asked me whether I had been accustomed to secure Sicilians places at the gladiatorial shows? No, said I. Well, I intend to start the practice, said he, as their new patron; but my sister, 38 who has the control of such a large part of the consul's space, won't give me more than a single foot. Don't grumble, said I, about one of your sister's feet; you may lift the other also. A jest, you will say, unbecoming to a consular. I confess it, but I detest that woman—so unworthy of a consul. For “ A shrew she is and with her husband jars, ” and not only with Metellus, but also with Fabius, 39 because she is annoyed at their interference in this business. 40 You ask about the agrarian law: it has completely lost all interest, I think. You rather chide me, though gently, about my intimacy with Pompey. I would not have you think that I have made friends with him for my own protection; but things had come to such a pass that, if by any chance we had quarreled, there would inevitably have been violent dissensions in the state. And in taking precautions and making provision against that, I by no means swerved from my well-known loyalist policy, but my object was to make him more of a loyalist and induce him to drop somewhat of his time-serving vacillation: and he, let me assure you, now speaks in much higher terms of my achievements (against which many had tried to incite him) than of his own. He testifies that while he served the state well, I preserved it. What if I even make a better citizen of Caesar, 41 who has now the wind full in his sails—am I doing so poor a service to the Republic? Furthermore, if there was no one to envy me, if all, as they ought to be, were my supporters, nevertheless a preference should still be given to a treatment that would cure the diseased parts of the state, rather than to the use of the knife. As it is, however, since the knighthood, which I once stationed on the slope of the Capitoline, 42 with you as their standard-bearer and leader, has deserted the senate, and since our leading men think themselves in a seventh heaven, if there are bearded mullets in their fish-ponds that will come to hand for food, and neglect everything else, do not you think that I am doing no mean service if I secure that those who have the power, should not have the will, to do any harm? As for our friend Cato, you do not love him more than I do: but after all, with the very best intentions and the most absolute honesty, he sometimes does harm to the Republic. He speaks and votes as though he were in the Republic of Plato, not in the scum of Romulus. What could be fairer than that a man should be brought to trial who has taken a bribe for his verdict? Cato voted for this: the senate agreed with him. The equites declared war on the senate, not on me, for I voted against it. What could be a greater piece of impudence than the equites renouncing the obligations of their contract? Yet for the sake of keeping the friendship of the order it was necessary to submit to the loss. Cato resisted and carried his point. Accordingly, though we have now had the spectacle of a consul thrown into prison, 43 of riots again and again stirred up, not one of those moved a finger to help, with whose support I and the consuls that immediately followed me were accustomed to defend the Republic. Well, but, say you, are we to pay them for their support? What are we to do if we can't get it on any other terms? Are we to be slaves to freedmen or even slaves? But, as you say, assez de serieux! Favonius 44 carried my tribe with better credit than his own; he lost that of Lucceius. His accusation of Nasica 45 was not creditable, but was conducted with moderation: he spoke so badly that he appeared when in Rhodes to have ground at the mills more than at the lessons of Molon. 46 He was somewhat angry with me because I appeared for the defence: however, he is now making up to me again on public grounds. I will write you word how Lucceius is getting on when I have seen Caesar, who will be here in a couple of days. The injury done you by the Sicyonians you attribute to Cato and his imitator Servilius. 47 Why? did not that blow reach many excellent citizens? But since the senate has so determined, let us commend it, and not be in a minority of one. 48 My Amaltheia 49 is waiting and longing for you. My Tusculan and Pompeian properties please me immensely, except that they have overwhelmed me—me, the scourge of debt—not exactly in Corinthian bronze, but in the bronze which is current in the market. 50 In Gaul I hope peace is restored. My Prognostics, 51 along with my poor speeches, expect shortly. Yet write and tell me what your ideas are as to returning. For Pomponia sent a message to me that you would be at Rome some time in July. That does not agree with your letter which you wrote to me about your name being put on the Census roll. Paetus, as I have already told you, has presented me with all books left by his brother. This gift of his depends upon your seeing to it with care. Pray, if you love me, take measures for their preservation and transmission to me. You could do me no greater favour, and I want the Latin books preserved with as much care as the Greek. I shall look upon them as virtually a present from yourself. I have written to Octavius : 52 I had not said anything to him about you by word of mouth; for I did not suppose that you carried on your business in that province, or look upon you in the light of general money-lender: but I have written, as in duty bound, with all seriousness. XXVII (A II, 2) TO ATTICUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME) TUSCULUM (DECEMBER) Take care of my dear nephew Cicero, I beg of you. I seem to share his illness. I am engaged on the Constitution of Pellene , and, by heaven, have piled up a huge heap of Dicaearchus at my feet. 53 What a great man! You may learn much more from him than from Procilius. His Constitution of Corinth and Constitution of Athens I have, I think, at Rome . Upon my word, you will say, if you read these, What a remarkable man! Herodes, if he had any sense, would have read him rather than write a single letter himself. 54 He has attacked me by letter; with you I see he has come to close quarters. I would have joined a conspiracy rather than resisted one, if I had thought that I should have to listen to him as my reward. As to Lollius, you must be mad. As to the wine, I think you are right. 55 But look here! Don't you see that the Kalends are approaching, and no Antonius ? 56 That the jury is being empanelled? For so they send me word. That Nigidius 57 threatens in public meeting that he will personally cite any juror who does not appear? However, I should be glad if you would write me word whether you have heard anything about the return of Antonius; and since you don't mean to come here, dine with me in any case on the 29th. Mind you do this, and take care of your health. XXVIII (A II, 3) TO ATTICUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME ） ROME (DECEMBER) First, I have good news for you, as I think. Valerius has been acquitted. Hortensius was his counsel. The verdict is thought to have been a favour to Aulus's son; and Epicrates, 58 I suspect, has been up to some mischief. I didn't like his boots and his white leggings. 59 What it is I shall know when you arrive. When you find fault with the narrow windows, let me tell you that you are criticising the Cyropaedeia . 60 For when I made the same remark, Cyrus used to answer that the views of the gardens through broad lights were not so pleasant. For let α be the eye, βγ the object seen, δ and ε the rays ... you see the rest. 61 For if sight resulted from the impact of images, 62 the images would be in great difficulties with a narrow entrance: but, as it is, that effusion of rays gets on quite nicely. If you have any other fault to find you won't get off without an answer, unless it is something that can be put right without expense. I now come to January and my political attitude, in which, after the manner of the Socratics, I shall put the two sides; at the end, however, as they were wont to do, the one which I approve. It is, indeed, a matter for profound refection. For I must either firmly oppose the agrarian law—which will involve a certain struggle, but a struggle full of glory—or I must remain altogether passive, which is about equivalent to retiring to Solonium 63 or Antium ; or, lastly, I must actually assist the bill, which I am told Caesar fully expects from me without any doubt. For Cornelius has been with me (I mean Cornelius Balbus, 64 Caesar's intimate), and solemnly assured me that he meant to avail himself of my advice and Pompey's in everything, and intended to endeavour to reconcile Crassus with Pompey. 65 In this last course there are the following advantages: a very close union with Pompey, and, if I choose, with Caesar also; a reconciliation with my political enemies, peace with the common herd, ease for my old age. But the conclusion of the third book of my own poem has a strong hold on me: “ Meanwhile the tenor of thy youth's first spring, Which still as consul thou with all thy soul And all thy manhood heldest, see thou keep, And swell the chorus of all good men's praise. ” 66 These verses Calliope herself dictated to me in that book, which contains much written in an aristocratic spirit, and I cannot, therefore, doubt that I shall always hold that “ The best of omens is our country's cause. ” 67 But let us reserve all this for our walks during the Compitalia. 68 Remember the day before the Compitalia. I will order the bath to be heated, and Terentia is going to invite Pomponia. We will add your mother to the party. Please bring me Theophrastus de Ambitione from my brother's library. XXIX (Q FR I, 1) TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN ASIA) ROME (DECEMBER) Though I have no doubt that many messengers, 69 and even common rumour, with its usual speed, will anticipate this letter, and that you will already have heard from others that a third year has been added to my loss and your labour, yet I thought you ought to receive from me also the news of this tiresome circumstance. For not in one, but in several of my previous letters, in spite of others having given up the idea in despair, I gave you hope of being able at an early date to quit your province, not only that I might as long as possible cheer you with a pleasurable belief, but also because I and the praetors took such pains in the matter, that I felt no misgiving as to the possibility of its being arranged. As it is, since matters have so turned out that neither the praetors by the weight of their influence, nor I by my earnest efforts, have been able to prevail, it is certainly difficult not to be annoyed, yet our minds, practised as they are in conducting and supporting business of the utmost gravity, ought not to be crushed or weakened by vexation. And since men ought to feel most vexed at what has been brought upon them by their own fault, it is I who ought in this matter to be more vexed than you. For it is the result of a fault on my part, against which you had protested both in conversation at the moment of your departure, and in letters since, that your successor was not named last year. In this, while consulting for the interests of our allies, and resisting the shameless conduct of some merchants, and while seeking the increase of our reputation by your virtues, I acted unwisely, especially as I made it possible for that second year to entail a third. And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it lies with your wisdom and kindness to remedy it, and to see that my imprudence is turned to advantage by your careful performance of your duties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every direction to earn men's good word, not with a view to rival others, but henceforth to surpass yourself, if you rouse your whole mind and your every thought and care to the ambition of gaining a superior reputation in all respects, believe me, one year added to your labour will bring us, nay, our posterity also, a joy of many years' duration. Wherefore I begin by entreating you not to let your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to allow yourself to be overpowered by the magnitude of the business as though by a wave; but, on the contrary, to stand upright and keep your footing, or even advance to meet the flood of affairs. For you are not administering a department of the state, in which fortune reigns supreme, but one in which a well-considered policy and an attention to business are the most important things. But if I had seen you receiving the prolongation of a command in a great and dangerous war, I should have trembled in spirit, because I should have known that the dominion of fortune over us had been at the same time prolonged. As it is, however, a department of the state has been entrusted to you in which fortune occupies no part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and which appears to me to depend entirely on your virtue and self-control. We have no reason to fear, as far as I know, any designs of our enemies, any actual fighting in the field, any revolts of allies, any default in the tribute or in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army: things which have very often befallen the wisest of men in such a way, that they have been no more able to get the better of the assault of been granted profound peace, a dead calm: yet if the pilot fortune, than the best of pilots a violent tempest. You have falls asleep, it may even so overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may give him positive pleasure. For your province consists, in the first place, of allies of a race which; of all the world, is the most civilized; and, in the second place, of Citizens, who, either as being publicani are very closely connected with me, or, as being traders who have made money, think that they owe the security of their property to my consulship. [ 2 ] But it may be said that among even such men as these there occur serious disputes, many wrongful acts are committed, and hotly contested litigation is the result. As though I ever thought that you had no trouble to contend with! I know that the trouble is exceedingly great, and such as demands the very greatest prudence; but remember that it is prudence much more than fortune on which, in my opinion, the result of your trouble depends. For what trouble is it to govern those over whom you are set, if you do but govern yourself? That may be a great and difficult task to others, and indeed it is most difficult: to you it has always been the easiest thing in the world, and indeed ought to be so, for your natural disposition is such that, even without discipline, it appears capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has, in fact, been applied that might educate the most faulty of characters. But while you resist, as you do, money, pleasure, and every kind of desire yourself, there will, I am to be told, be a risk of your not being able to suppress some fraudulent banker or some rather over-extortionate tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will think, as they behold the innocence of your life, that one of the heroes of their history, or a demigod from heaven, has come down into the province. And this I say, not to induce you to act thus, but to make you glad that you are acting or have acted so. It is a splendid thing to have been three years in supreme power in Asia without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery, slave, anyone's good looks, or any offer of money—all of which are plentiful in your province—to cause you to swerve from the most absolute honesty and purity of life. What can be imagined so striking or so desirable as that a virtue, a command over the passions, a self-control such as yours, are not remaining in darkness and obscurity, but have been set in the broad daylight of Asia , before the eyes of a famous province, and in the hearing of all nations and peoples? That the inhabitants are not being ruined by your progresses, drained by your charges, agitated by your approach? That there is the liveliest joy, public and private, wheresoever you come, the city regarding you as a protector and not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not a plunderer? [ 3 ] But in these matters I am sure that mere experience has by this time taught you that it is by no means sufficient to have these virtues yourself, but that you must keep your eyes open and vigilant, in order that in the guardianship of your province you may be considered to vouch to the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for yourself alone, but for all the subordinates of your government. However, you have in the persons of your legati men likely to have a regard for their own reputation. Of these in rank, position, and age Tubero is first; who, I think, particularly as he is a writer of history, could select from his own Annals many whom he would like and would be able to imitate. Allienus, again, is ours, as well in heart and affection, as in his conformity to our principles. I need not speak of Gratidius: I am sure that, while taking pains to preserve his own reputation, his fraternal affection for us makes him take pains for ours also. 70 Your quaestor is not of your own selection, but the one assigned you by lot. He is bound both to act with propriety of his own accord, and to conform to the policy and principles which you lay down. But should any one of these adopt a lower standard of conduct, you should tolerate such behaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in his private capacity, of the rules by which he was bound, but not if it goes to the extent of employing for gain the authority which you granted him as a promotion. For I am far from thinking, especially since the moral sentiments of the day are so much inclined to excessive laxity and self-seeking, that you should investigate every case of petty misconduct, and thoroughly examine every one of these persons; but that you should regulate your confidence by the trustworthiness of its recipient. And among such persons you will have to vouch for those whom the Republic has itself given you as companions and assistants in public affairs, at least within the limits which I have before laid down. [ 4 ] In the case, however, of those of your personal staff or official attendants whom you have yourself selected to be about you—who are usually spoken of as a kind of praetor's cohort—we must vouch, not only for their acts, but even for their words. But those you have with you are the sort of men of whom you may easily be fond when they are acting rightly, and whom you may very easily check when they show insufficient regard for your reputation. By these, when you were raw to the work, your frank disposition might possibly have been deceived—for the better a man is the less easily does he suspect others of being bad—now, however, let this third year witness an integrity as perfect as the two former, but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that only which you are supposed to listen to; don't let your ears be open to whispered falsehoods and interested suggestions. Don't let your signet ring be a mere implement, but, as it were, your second self: not the minister of another's will, but a witness of your own. Let your marshal hold the rank which our ancestors wished him to hold, who, looking upon this place as not one of profit, but of labour and duty, scarcely ever conferred it upon any but their freedmen, whom they indeed controlled almost as absolutely as their slaves. Let the lictor be the dispenser of your clemency, not his own; and let the fasces and axes which they carry before you constitute ensigns rather of rank than of power. Let it, in fact, be known to the whole province that the life, children, fame, and fortunes of all over whom you preside are exceedingly dear to you. Finally, let it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be hostile not only to those who have accepted a bribe, but to those also who have given it. And, indeed, no one will give anything, if it is made quite clear that nothing is usually obtained from you through those who pretend to be very influential with you. Not, however, that the object of this discourse is to make you over-harsh or suspicious towards your staff. For if any of them in the course of the last two years has never fallen under suspicion of rapacity, as I am told about Caesius and Chaerippus and Labeo—and think it true, because I know them—there is no authority, I think, which may not be entrusted to them, and no confidence which may not be placed in them with the utmost propriety, and in anyone else like them. But if there is anyone of whom you have already had reason to doubt, or concerning whom you have made some discovery, in such a man place no confidence, intrust him with no particle of your reputation. V. If, however, you have found in the province itself anyone, hitherto unknown to us, who has made his way into intimacy with you, take care how much confidence you repose in him; not that there may not be many good provincials, but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be positive. For everyone's real character is covered by many wrappings of pretence and is concealed by a kind of veil: face, eyes, expression very often lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can you expect to find in that class 71 any who, while foregoing for the sake of money all from which we can scarcely tear ourselves away, 72 will yet love you sincerely and not merely pretend to do so from interested motives? I think, indeed, it is a hard task to find such men, especially if we notice that the same persons care nothing for almost any man out of office, yet always with one consent show affection for the praetors. But of this class, if by chance you have discovered any one to be fonder of you—for it may so happen—than of your office, such a man indeed gladly admit upon your list of friends: but if you fail to perceive that, there is no Class of people you must be more on your guard against admitting to intimacy, just because they are acquainted with all the ways of making money, do everything for the sake of it, and have no consideration for the reputation of a man with whom they are not destined to pass their lives. And even among the Greeks themselves you must be on your guard against admitting close intimacies, except in the case of the very few, if such are to be found, who are worthy of ancient Greece . As things now stand, indeed, too many of them are untrustworthy, false, and schooled by long servitude in the arts of extravagant adulation. My advice is that these men should all be entertained with courtesy, but that close ties of hospitality or friendship should only be formed with the best of them: excessive intimacies with them are not very trustworthy—for they do not venture to oppose our wishes—and they are not only jealous of our countrymen, but of their own as well. VI. And now, considering the caution and care that I would show in matters of this kind—in which I fear I may be somewhat over-severe—what do you suppose my sentiments are in regard to slaves? Upon these we ought to keep a hold in all places, but especially in the provinces. On this head many rules may be laid down, but this is at once the shortest and most easily maintained—that they should behave during your progresses in Asia as though you were travelling on the Appian way, and not suppose that it makes any difference whether they have arrived at Tralles or Formiae . But if, again, any one of your slaves is conspicuously trustworthy, employ him in your domestic and private affairs; but in affairs pertaining to your office as governor, or in any department of the state, do not let him lay a finger. For many things which may, with perfect propriety, be in-trusted to slaves, must yet not be so entrusted, for the sake of avoiding talk and hostile remark. But my discourse, I know not how, has slipped into the didactic vein, though that is not what I proposed to myself originally. For what right have I to be laying down rules for one who, I am fully aware, in this subject especially, is not my inferior in wisdom, while in experience he is even my superior? Yet, after all, if your actions had the additional weight of my approval, I thought that they would seem more satisfactory to yourself. Wherefore, let these be the foundations on which your public character rests: first and foremost your own honesty and self-control, then the scrupulous conduct of all your staff, the exceedingly cautious and careful selection in regard to intimacies with provincials and Greeks, the strict and unbending government of your slaves. These are creditable even in the conduct of our private and everyday business: in such an important government, where morals are so debased and the province has such a corrupting influence, they must needs seem divine. Such principles and conduct on your part are sufficient to justify the strictness which you have displayed in some acts of administration, owing to which I have encountered certain personal disputes with great satisfaction, unless, indeed, you suppose me to be annoyed by the complaints of a fellow like Paconius—who is not even a Greek, but in reality a Mysian or Phrygian—or by the words of Tuscenius, a madman and a knave, from whose abominable jaws you snatched the fruits of a most infamous piece of extortion with the most complete justice. [ 7 ] These and similar instances of your strict administration in your province we shall find difficulty in justifying, unless they are accompanied by the most perfect integrity: wherefore let there be the greatest strictness in your administration of justice, provided only that it is never varied from favour, but is kept up with impartiality. But it is of little avail that justice is administered by yourself with impartiality and care, unless the same is done by those to whom you have entrusted any portion of this duty. And, indeed, in my view there is no very great variety of business in the government of Asia : the entire province mainly depends on the administration of justice. In it we have the whole theory of government, especially of provincial government, clearly displayed: all that a governor has to do is to show consistency and firmness enough, not only td resist favouritism, but even the suspicion of it. To this also must be added courtesy in listening to pleaders, consideration in pronouncing a decision, and painstaking efforts to convince suitors of its justice, and to answer their arguments. It is by such habits that C. Octavius has recently made himself very popular; 73 in whose court, for the first time, 74 the lictor did not interfere, and the marshal kept silence, while every suitor spoke as often and as long as he chose. In which conduct he would perhaps have been thought over-lax, had it not been that this laxity enabled him to maintain the following in stance of severity. The partisans of Sulla were forced to restore what they had taken by violence and terrorism. Those who had made inequitable decrees; while in office, were now as private citizens forced to submit to the principles they had established. This strictness on his part would have been thought harsh, had it not been rendered palatable by many sweetening influences of courtesy. But if this gentleness was sufficient to make him popular at Rome , where there is such haughtiness of spirit, such unrestrained liberty, such unlimited licence of individuals, and, in fine, so many magistrates, so many means of obtaining protection, such vast power in the hands of the popular assembly, and such influence exercised by the senate, how welcome must a praetor's courtesy be in Asia , in which there is such a numerous body of citizens and allies, so many cities, so many communities, all hanging on one man's nod, and in which there are no means of protection, no one to whom to make a complaint, no senate, no popular assembly! Wherefore it requires an exalted character, a man who is not only equitable from natural impulse, but who has also been trained by study and the refinements of a liberal education, so to conduct himself while in the possession of such immense power, that those over whom he rules should not feel the want of any other power. [ 8 ] Take the case of the famous Cyrus, portrayed by Xenophon, not as an historical character, but as a model of righteous government, the serious dignity of whose character is represented by that philosopher as combined with a peculiar courtesy. And, indeed, it is not without reason that our hero Africanus used perpetually to have those books in his hands, for there is no duty pertaining to a careful and equitable governor which is not to be found in them. Well, if he cultivated those qualities, though never destined to be in a private station, how carefully ought those to maintain them to whom power is given with the understanding that it must be surrendered, and given by laws under whose authority they must once more come? In my opinion all who govern others are bound to regard as the object of all their actions the greatest happiness of the governed. That this is your highest object, and has been so since you first landed in Asia , has been published abroad by Consistent rumour and the conversation of all. It is, let me add, not only the duty of one who governs allies and citizens, but even of one who governs slaves and dumb animals, to serve the interests and advantage of those under him. In this point I notice that everyone agrees that you take the greatest pains: no new debt is being contracted by the states, while many have been relieved by you from a heavy and long-standing one. Several cities that had become dilapidated and almost deserted—of which one was the most famous state in Ionia , the other in Caria , Samus and Halicarnassus—have been given a new life by you: there is no party fighting, no civil strife in the towns: you take care that the government of the states is administered by the best class of citizens: brigandage is abolished in Mysia ; murder suppressed in many districts; peace is established throughout the province; and not only the robberies usual on highways and in country places, but those more numerous and more serious ones in towns and temples, have been completely stopped: the fame, fortunes, and repose of the rich have been relieved of that most oppressive instrument of praetorial rapacity-vexatious prosecution; the expenses and tribute of the states are made to fall with equal weight on all who live in the territories of those states: access to you is as easy as possible: your ears are open to the complaints of all: no man's want of means or want of friends excludes him, I don't say from access to you in public and on the tribunal, but -even from your house and chamber: in a word, throughout your government there is no harshness or cruelty-everywhere clemency, mildness, and kindness reign supreme. [ 9 ] What an immense benefit, again, have you done in having liberated Asia from the tribute exacted by the aediles, a measure which cost me some violent controversies! For if one of our nobles complains openly that by your edict, No moneys shall be voted for the games, you have robbed him of 200 sestertia, what a vast sum of money would have been paid, had a grant been made to the Credit of every magistrate who held games, as had become the regular custom! However, I stopped these Complaints by taking up this position—what they think of it in Asia I don't know, in Rome it meets with no little approval and praise—I refused to accept a sum of money which the states had decreed for a temple and monument in our honour, though they had done so with the greatest enthusiasm in view both of my services and of your most valuable benefactions; and though the law contained a special and distinct exception in these words, that it was lawful to receive for temple or monument ; and though again the money was not going to be thrown away, but would be employed on decorating a temple, and would thus appear to have been given to the Roman people and gift in its favour, I determined that I must not accept it, for the immortal Gods rather than to myself—yet, in spite of its having desert, law, and the wishes of those who offered the this reason among others, namely, to prevent those, to whom such an honour was neither due nor legal, from being jealous. Wherefore adhere with all your heart and soul to the policy which you have hitherto adopted—that of being devoted to those whom the senate and people of Rome have committed and entrusted to your honour and authority, of doing your best to protect them, and of desiring their greatest happiness. Even if the lot had made you governor of Africans, or Spaniards, or Gauls—uncivilized and barbarous nations—it would still have been your duty as a man of feeling to consult for their interests and advantage, and to have contributed to their safety. But when we rule over a race of men in which civilization not only exists, but from which it is believed to have spread to others, we are bound to repay them, above all things, what we received from them. For I shall not be ashamed to go so far—especially as my life and achievements have been such as to exclude any suspicion of sloth or frivolity—as to confess that, whatever I have accomplished, I have accomplished by means of those studies and principles which have been transmitted to us in Greek literature and schools of thought. Wherefore, over and above the general good faith which is due to all men, I think we are in a special sense under an obligation to that nation, to put in practice what it has taught us among the very men by whose maxims we have been brought out of barbarism. [ 10 ] And indeed Plato, the fountain-head of genius and learning, thought that states would only be happy when scholars and philosophers began being their rulers, or when those who were their rulers had devoted all their attention to learning and philosophy. It was plainly this union of power and philosophy that in his opinion might prove the salvation of states. And this perhaps has at length fallen to the fortune of the whole empire: certainly it has in the present instance to your province, to have a man in supreme power in it, who has from boyhood spent the chief part of his zeal and time in imbibing the principles of philosophy, virtue, and humanity. Wherefore be careful that this third year, which has been added to your labour, may be thought a prolongation of prosperity to Asia . And since Asia was more fortunate in retaining you than I was in my endeavour to bring you back, see that my regret is softened by the exultation of the province. For if you have displayed the very greatest activity in earning honours such as, I think, have never been paid to anyone else, much greater ought your activity to be in preserving these honours. What I for my part think of honours of that kind I have told you in previous letters. I have always regarded them, if given indiscriminately, as of little value, if paid from interested motives, as worthless: if, however, as in this case, they are tributes to solid services on your part, I hold you bound to take much pains in preserving them. Since, then, you are exercising supreme power and official authority in cities, in which you have before your eyes the consecration and apotheosis of your virtues, in all decisions, decrees, and official acts consider what you owe to those warm opinions entertained of you, to those verdicts on your character, to those honours which have been rendered you. And what you owe will be to consult for the interests of all, to remedy men's misfortunes, to provide for their safety, to resolve that you will be both called and believed to be the father of Asia . [ 11 ] However, to such a resolution and deliberate policy on your part the great obstacle are the publicani : for, if we oppose them, we shall alienate from ourselves and from the Republic an order which has done us most excellent service, and which has been brought into sympathy with the Republic by our means; if, on the other hand, we comply with them in every case, we shall allow the complete ruin of those whose interests, to say nothing of their preservation, we are bound to consult. This is the one difficulty, if we look the thing fairly in the face, in your whole government. For disinterested conduct on one's own part, the suppression of all inordinate desires, the keeping a check upon one's staff, courtesy in hearing causes, in listening to and admitting suitor—all this is rather a question of credit than of difficulty: for it does not depend on any special exertion, but rather on a mental resolve and inclination. But how much bitterness of feeling is caused to allies by that question of the publicani we have had reason to know in the case of citizens who, when recently urging the removal of the port-dues in Italy , did not complain so much of the dues themselves, as of certain extortionate conduct on the part of the collectors. Wherefore, after hearing the grievances of citizens in Italy , I can comprehend what happens to allies in distant lands. To conduct oneself in this matter in such a way as to satisfy the publicani especially when contracts have been undertaken at a loss, and yet to preserve the allies from ruin, seems to demand a virtue with something divine in it, I mean a virtue like yours. To begin with, that they are subject to tax at all, which is their greatest grievance, ought not to be thought so by the Greeks, because they were so subject by their own laws without the Roman government. Again, they cannot despise the word publicanus , for they have been unable to pay the assessment according to Sulla's poll-tax without the aid of the publican. But that Greek publicani are not more considerate in exacting the payment of taxes than our own may be gathered from the fact that the Caunii, and all the islands assigned to the Rhodians by Sulla, recently appealed to the protection of the senate, and petitioned to be allowed to pay their tax to us rather than to the Rhodians. Wherefore neither ought those to revolt at the name of a publicanus who have always been subject to tax, nor those to despise it who have been unable to make up the tribute by themselves, nor those to refuse his services who have asked for them. At the same time let Asia reflect on this, that if she were not under our government, there is no calamity of foreign war or internal strife from which she would be free. And since that government cannot possibly be maintained without taxes, she should be content to purchase perpetual peace and tranquillity at the price of a certain proportion of her products. [ 12 ] But if they will fairly reconcile themselves to the existence and name of publican, all the rest may be made to appear to them in a less offensive light by your skill and prudence. They may, in making their bargains with the publicani , not have regard so much to the exact conditions laid down by the censors as to the convenience of settling the business and freeing themselves from farther trouble. You also may do, what you have done splendidly and are still doing, namely, dwell on the high position of the publicani , and on your obligations to that order, in such a way as—putting out of the question all considerations of your imperium and the power of your official authority and dignity—to reconcile the Greeks with the publicani ; and to beg of those, whom you have served eminently well, and who owe you everything, to suffer you by their compliance to maintain and preserve the bonds which unite us with the publicani . But why do I address these exhortations to you, who are not only capable of carrying them out of your own accord without anyone's instruction, but have already to a great extent thoroughly done so? For the most respectable and important companies do not cease offering me thanks daily, and this is all the more gratifying to me because the Greeks do the same. Now it is an achievement of great difficulty to unite in feeling things which are opposite in interests, aims, and, I had almost said, in their very nature. But I have not written all this to instruct you—for your wisdom requires no man's instruction—but it has been a pleasure to me while writing to set down your virtues, though I have run to greater length in this letter than I could have wished, or than I thought I should. [ 13 ] There is one thing on which I shall not cease from giving you advice, nor will I, as far as in me lies, allow your praise to be spoken of with a reservation. For all who come from your province do make one reservation in the extremely high praise which they bestow on your virtue, integrity, and kindness—it is that of sharpness of temper. That is a fault which, even in our private and everyday life, seems to indicate want of solidity and strength of mind; but nothing, surely, can be more improper than to combine harshness of temper with the exercise of supreme power. Wherefore I will not undertake to lay before you now what the greatest philosophers say about anger, for I should not wish to be tedious, and you can easily ascertain it yourself from the writings of many of them: but I don't think I ought to pass over what is the essence of a letter, namely, that the recipient should be informed of what he does not know. Well, what nearly everybody reports to me is this: they usually say that, as long as you are not out of temper, nothing can be pleasanter than you are, but that when some instance of dishonesty or wrong-headedness has stirred you, your temper rises to such a height that no one Can discover any trace of your usual kindness. Wherefore, since no mere desire for glory, but circumstances and fortune have brought us upon a path of life which makes it inevitable that men will always talk about us, let us be on our guard, to the utmost of our means and ability, that no glaring fault may be alleged to have existed in us. And I am not now urging, what is perhaps difficult in human nature generally, and at our time of life especially, that you should change your disposition and suddenly pluck out a deeply-rooted habit, but I give you this hint: if you cannot completely avoid this failing, because your mind is surprised by anger before cool calculation has been able to prevent it, deliberately prepare yourself beforehand, and daily reflect on the duty of resisting anger, and that, when it moves your heart most violently, it is just the time for being most careful to restrain your tongue. And that sometimes seems to me to be a. greater virtue than not being angry at all. For the latter is not always a mark of superiority to weakness, it is sometimes the result of dullness; but to govern temper and speech, however angry you may be, or even to hold your tongue and keep your indignant feelings and resentment under control, although it may not be a proof of perfect wisdom, yet requires no ordinary force of character. And, indeed, in this respect they tell me that you are now much more gentle and less irritable. No violent outbursts of indignation on your part, no abusive words, no insulting language are reported to me: which, while quite alien to culture and refinement, are specially unsuited to high power and place. For if your anger is implacable, it amounts to extreme harshness; if easily appeased, to extreme weakness. The latter, however, as a choice of evils, is, after all, preferable to harshness. [ 14 ] But since your first year gave rise to most talk in regard to this particular complaint—I believe because the wrong-doing, the covetousness, and the arrogance of men came upon you as a surprise, and seemed to you unbearable-while your second year was much milder, because habit and refection, and, as I think, my letters also, rendered you more tolerant and gentle, the third ought to be so completely reformed, as not to give even the smallest ground for anyone to find fault. And here I go on to urge upon you, not by way of exhortation or admonition, but by brotherly entreaties, that you would set your whole heart, care, and thought on the gaining of praise from everybody and from every quarter. If, indeed, our achievements were only the subject of a moderate amount of talk and commendation, nothing eminent, nothing beyond the practice of others, would have been demanded of you. As it is, however, owing to the brilliancy and magnitude of the affairs in which we have been engaged, if we do not obtain the very highest reputation from your province, it seems scarcely possible for us to avoid the most violent abuse. Our position is such that all loyalists support us, but demand also and expect from us every kind of activity and virtue, while all the disloyal, seeing that we have entered upon a lasting war with them, appear contented with the very smallest excuse for attacking us. Wherefore, since fortune has allotted to you such a theatre as Asia , completely packed with an audience, of immense size, of the most refined judgment, and, moreover, naturally so capable of conveying sound, that its expressions of opinion and its remarks reach Rome , put out all your power, I beseech you, exert all your energies to appear not only to have been worthy of the part we played here, but to have surpassed everything done there by your high qualities. [ 15 ] And since chance has assigned to me among the magistracies the Conduct of public business in the city, to you that in a province, if my share is inferior to no one's, take care that yours surpasses others. At the same time think of this: we are not now working for a future and prospective glory, but are fighting in defence of what has been already gained; which indeed it was not so much an object to gain as it is now our duty to defend. And if anything in me could be apart from you, I should desire nothing more than the position which I have already gained. The actual fact, however, is that unless all your acts and deeds in your province correspond to my achievements, I shall think that I have gained nothing by those great labours and dangers, in all of which you have shared. But if it was you who, above all others, assisted me to gain a most splendid reputation, you will certainly also labour more than others to enable me to retain it. You must not be guided by the opinions and judgments of the present generation only, but of those to come also: and yet the latter will be a more candid judgment, for it will not be influenced by detraction and malice. Finally, you should think of this—that you are not seeking glory for yourself alone (and even if that were the case, you still ought not to be careless of it, especially as you had determined to consecrate the memory of your name by the most splendid monuments), but you have to share it with me, and to hand it down to our children. In regard to which you must be on your guard lest by any excess of carelessness you should seem not only to have neglected your own interests, but to have begrudged those of your family also. [ 16 ] And these observations are not made with the idea of any speech of mine appearing to have roused you from your sleep, but to have rather added speed to the runner. For you will continue to compel all in the future, as you have compelled them in the past, to praise your equity, self-control, strictness, and honesty. But from my extreme affection I am possessed with a certain insatiable greed for glory for you. However, I am convinced that, as Asia should now be as well-known to you as each man's own house is to himself, and since to your supreme good sense such great experience has now been added, there is nothing that affects reputation which you do not know as well as possible yourself, and which does not daily occur to your mind without anybody's exhortation. But I, who when I read your writing seem to hear your voice, and when I write to you seem to be talking to you, am therefore always best pleased with your longest letter, and in writing am often somewhat prolix myself. My last prayer and advice to you is that, as good poets and painstaking actors always do, so you should be most attentive in the last scenes and conclusion of your function and business, so that this third year of your government, like a third act in a play, may appear to have been the most elaborated and most highly finished. You will do that with more ease if you will think that I, whom you always wished to please more than all the world besides, am always at your side, and am taking part in everything you say and do. It remains only to beg you to take the greatest care of your health, if you wish me and all your friends to be well also. Farewell.","Note: 1 Reading (mainly with Schutz) animus  praesens  et  voluntas , tamen  etiam  atque  etiam  ipsa  medicinam  refugit . The verb refugit is very doubtful, but it gives                                                   nearly the sense required. Cicero is ready to be                                                   as brave and active as before, but the state will                                                   not do its part. It has, for instance, blundered                                                   in the matter of the law against judicial                                                   corruption. The senate offended the equites by proposing it, and                                                   yet did not carry the law. I think animus and voluntas must refer to Cicero, not the                                                   state, to which in his present humour he would not                                                   attribute them.,Note: 2 The temple of Iuventas was vowed by M.                                                   Livius after the battle of the Metaurus (B.C. 207), and dedicated in                                                   B.C. 191 by C. Licinius                                                   Lucullus, games being established on the                                                   anniversary of its dedication ( Livy, 21.62 ; 36.36). It is                                                   suggested, therefore, that some of the Luculli usually presided at                                                   these games, but on this occasion refused, because                                                   of the injury done by C. Memmius, who was curule                                                   aedile.,Note: 3 By Agamemnon and Menelaus                                                   Cicero means Lucius and Marcus Lucullus; the                                                   former Memmius had, as tribune in B.C. 66-65, opposed in his                                                   demand for a triumph, the latter he has now                                                   injured in the person of his wife.,Note: 4 A                                                   man who was sui  juris was properly adopted before the comitia  curiatia , now represented by                                                   thirty lictors. What Herennius proposed was that                                                   it should take place by a regular lex , passed by the comitia  tributa . The object                                                   apparently was to avoid the necessity of the                                                   presence of a pontifex and augur, which was                                                   required at the comitia  curiata . The concurrent law by the consul would come                                                   before the comitia  centuriata . The adopter was P. Fonteius,                                                   a very young man.,Note: 5 L. Afranius, the                                                   other consul .,Note: 6 M. Lollius                                                   Palicanus,  a mere mob orator  ( Brutus, §                                                   223 ).,Note: 7 The toga  picta of a triumphator , which                                                   Pompey, by special law, was authorized to wear at                                                   the games. Cicero uses the contemptuous                                                   diminutive, togula .,Note: 8 To be absent                                                   from the census without excuse rendered a man liable to penalties.                                                   Cicero will therefore put up notices in Atticus's                                                   various places of business or residence of his                                                   intention to appear in due course. To appear just                                                   at the end of the period was, it seems, in the                                                   case of a man of business, advisable, that he                                                   might be rated at the actual amount of his                                                   property, no more or less.,Note: 9 A special title given to the Aedui on their                                                   application for alliance.

Cicero puns on the name Lentulus                                                   from lens (pulse, φακή ) and quotes a Greek proverb for                                                   things incongruous. See Athenaeus 160 (from the Nekuia of Sopater ): “  Ἴθακος  Ὀδυσσεὺς , τὸ  ἐ ni `  τῇ  φακῇ  μύρον  πά resti : θάρσει , θυμέ .  ”,Note: 14 B.C. 133, the year                                                   before the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus. The                                                   law of Gracchus had not touched the public land in Campania (the old                                                   territory of Capua ).

They were not different from the other senators in                                                   point of legal rights, but as the ex-magistrates                                                   were asked for their sententia first, they seldom had time                                                   to do anything but signify by word their assent to                                                   one or other motion, or to cross over to the                                                   person whom they intended to support.,Note: 20 P.

As he had not yet been                                                   praetor, he would be called on after the consulares and praetorii . He then moved a new                                                   clause to the decree, and carried it.,Note: 21 The decree apparently                                                   prevented the recovery of debts from a libera  civitas in the Roman                                                   courts. Atticus would                                                   therefore have to trust to the regard of the                                                   Sicyonians for their credit.,Note: 22 A son must be                                                   hard up for something to say for himself if he is                                                   always harping on his father's reputation ; and so                                                   must I, if I have nothing but my consulship. That                                                   seems the only point in the quotation. I do not                                                   feel that there is any reference to praise of his                                                   father in Cicero's own poem. There are two                                                   versions of the proverb: τίς  πατέρ᾽  αἰνήσει  εἰ  μὴ  κακοδαίμονες  υἱοί ; and τίς  πατέρ᾽  αἰνήσει  εἰ  μὴ  εὐδαίμονες  υἱοί ; ,Note: 23 Contained in Letter XXII, pp.                                                   46-47.,Note: 24 Reading tibi for mihi , as Prof. Tyrrell suggests.,Note: 25  Σπάρτην  ἔλαχες  κείνην  κοσμεῖ .

The                                                   coalition with Pompey certainly, and with Crassus                                                   probably, had been already made and the terms                                                   agreed upon soon after the elections. If Cicero                                                   afterwards discovered this it must have shown him                                                   how little he could trust Pompey's show of                                                   friendship and Caesar's candour.

In B.C.                                                   61 (March) he went out to Asia as propraetor;                                                   his first year of office would be up in March,                                                   B.C. 60, but his                                                   governorship was, as was very common, extended                                                   till March, B.C. 59.                                                   Towards the end of B.C.                                                   60 the senate seems to have arranged not to                                                   appoint his successor, that is, he would be left                                                   in office till about March, B.C.                                                   58. It is in view of this third year of                                                   office that Cicero writes this essay-letter to him                                                   on the duties of a provincial governor.

We have seen how he was one of                                                   the few who managed to quarrel with Atticus ; and in B.C. 48 we shill find how                                                   fiercely he resented the exercise of his brother's                                                   influence which had led him to take the losing                                                   side, which from his attachment to Caesar he may                                                   have been half inclined to think the wrong side.

                                                  the triumvirate, which he yet distrusted as
                                                  dangerous to the constitution. We shall find him,
                                                  therefore, vacillating between giving his support

                                                  public affairs, my confidant in all private
                                                  business, the sharer in all my conversations and

                                                  abandoned by all, that the only moments of repose
                                                  left me are those which are spent with my wife,
                                                  pet daughter, and sweet little Cicero. For as to
                                                  those friendships with the great, and their
                                                  artificial attractions, they have indeed a certain
                                                  glitter in the outside world, but they bring no
                                                  private satisfaction. And so, after a crowded
                                                  morning levée, as I go down to the
                                                  forum surrounded by troops of friends, I can find
                                                  no one out of all that crowd with whom to jest
                                                  freely, or into whose ear I can breathe a familiar
                                                  sigh. Therefore I wait for you, I long for you, I
                                                  even urge on you to come for I have many
                                                  anxieties, many pressing cares, of which I think,
                                                  if I once had your ears to listen to me, I could
                                                  unburden myself in the conversation of a single
                                                  walk. And of my private anxieties, indeed, I shall
                                                  conceal all the stings and vexations, and not
                                                  trust them to this letter and an unknown
                                                  letter-carrier. These, however—for I

                                                  anxious—are not very painful: yet they
                                                  are persistent and worrying, and are not put to
                                                  rest by the advice or conversation of any friend.
                                                  But in regard to the Republic I have still the
                                                  same courage and purpose, though it has again and
                                                  again of its own act eluded treatment.,insert_note_53,1,For should I put briefly
                                                  what has occurred since you left, you would
                                                  certainly exclaim that the Roman empire cannot be
                                                  maintained much longer. Well, after your  departure our first scene, I think, was
                                                  the appearance of the Clodian scandal, in which
                                                  having, as I thought, got an opportunity of
                                                  pruning licentiousness and keeping our young men
                                                  within bounds, I exerted myself to the utmost, and
                                                  lavished all the resources of my intellect and
                                                  genius, not from dislike to an individual, but
                                                  from the hope of not merely correcting, but of
                                                  completely curing the state. The Republic received
                                                  a crushing blow when this jury was won over by
                                                  money and the opportunity of debauchery. See what
                                                  has followed we have had a consul inflicted upon
                                                  us, whom none except us philosophers can look at
                                                  without a sigh. What a blow that is ! Though a
                                                  decree of the senate has been passed about bribery
                                                  and the corruption of juries, no law has been
                                                  carried; the senate has been harassed to death,
                                                  the Roman knights alienated. So that one year has
                                                  undermined two buttresses of the Republic, which
                                                  owed their existence to me, and me alone; for it
                                                  has at once destroyed the prestige of the senate
                                                  and broken up the harmony of the orders. And now

                                                  Menelaus, being annoyed at that, divorced his
                                                  wife. Yet the old Idaean shepherd had only injured
                                                  Menelaus; our Roman Paris thought Agamemnon as

                                                  by promulgating (though only for form's sake) an

                                                  an answer being given them by the senate. And so

                                                  you have a view also of what I have not written,
                                                  come back to me, for it is time you did. And
                                                  though the state of affairs to which I invite you
                                                  is one to be avoided, yet let  your

                                                  meeting of the senate declared with one voice that
                                                  I must be kept in the city. The same occurred to
                                                  Pompey after me; so that we two appeared to be
                                                  kept at home as pledges of the safety of the
                                                  Republic. Why should I look for the ""bravos"" of
                                                  others when I get these compliments at home? Well,
                                                  the state of affairs in the city is as follows.
                                                  The agrarian law is being vehemently pushed by the
                                                  tribune Flavius, with the support of Pompey, but
                                                  it has nothing popular about it except its
                                                  supporter. From this law I, with the full assent
                                                  of a public meeting, proposed to omit all clauses
                                                  which adversely affected private rights. I
                                                  proposed to except from its operation such public
                                                  land as had been so in the consulship of P. Mucius
                                                  and L. Calpurnius.,insert_note_148,14,I proposed to confirm
                                                  the titles of holders of those to whom Sulla had
                                                  actually assigned lands. I proposed to retain the
                                                  men of,Volaterrae,and
                                                  Arretium—whose lands  Sulla
                                                  had declared forfeited but had not
                                                  allotted—in their holdings. There was
                                                  only one section in the bill that I did not
                                                  propose to omit, namely, that land should be
                                                  purchased with this money from abroad, the
                                                  proceeds of the new revenues for the next five
                                                  years.,insert_note_156,15,But to this whole agrarian scheme the
                                                  senate was opposed, suspecting that some novel
                                                  power for Pompey was aimed at. Pompey, indeed, had
                                                  set his heart on getting the law passed. I,
                                                  however, with the full approval of the applicants
                                                  for land, maintained the holdings of all private
                                                  owners—for, as you know, the landed
                                                  gentry form the bulk of our party's
                                                  forces—while I nevertheless satisfied
                                                  the people and Pompey (for I wanted to do that
                                                  also) by the purchase clause; for, if that was put
                                                  on a sound footing, I thought that two advantages
                                                  would accrue—the dregs might be drawn
                                                  from the city, and the deserted portions of,Italy,be
                                                  repeopled. But this whole business was interrupted
                                                  by the war, and has cooled off. Metellus is an
                                                  exceedingly good consul, and much attached to me.
                                                  That other one is such a ninny that he clearly
                                                  doesn't know what to do with his purchase.,insert_note_164,16,This is all my public news, unless you
                                                  regard as touching on public affairs the fact that
                                                  a certain Herennius, a tribune, and a fellow
                                                  tribesman of yours—a fellow as
                                                  unprincipled as he is needy—has now
                                                  begun making frequent proposals for transferring
                                                  P. Clodius to the plebs; he is vetoed by many of
                                                  his colleagues. That is really, I think, all the
                                                  public news.,For my part,
                                                  ever since I won what I may call the splendid and
                                                  immortal glory of the famous fifth of December,insert_note_170,17,(though it was accompanied by the jealousy
                                                  and hostility of many), I have never ceased to
                                                  play my part in the Republic in the same lofty
                                                  spirit, and to maintain the position I then
                                                  inaugurated and took upon myself. But when, first,
                                                  by the acquittal of Clodius I clearly perceived
                                                  the insecurity and rotten state of the law courts;
                                                  and, secondly, when I saw that it took so little
                                                  to alienate my friends the,publicani,from the
                                                  senate—though with me personally they
                                                  had no quarrel;  and, thirdly, that
                                                  the rich (I mean your friends the fish-breeders)
                                                  did not disguise their jealousy of me, I thought I
                                                  must look out for some greater security and
                                                  stronger support. So, to begin with, I have
                                                  brought the man who had been too long silent on my
                                                  achievements, Pompey himself, to such a frame of
                                                  mind as not once only in the senate, but many
                                                  times and in many words, to ascribe to me the
                                                  preservation of this empire and of the world. And
                                                  this was not so important to me—for
                                                  those transactions are neither so obscure as to
                                                  need and Pompey from a difference of opinion on
                                                  these measures. testimony, nor so dubious as to
                                                  need commendation—as to the Republic;
                                                  for there were certain persons base enough to
                                                  think that some misunderstanding would arise
                                                  between me with him I have united myself in such
                                                  close intimacy that both of us can by this union
                                                  be better fortified in his own views, and more
                                                  secure in his political position. However, the
                                                  dislike of the licentious dandies, which had been
                                                  roused against me, has been so far softened by a
                                                  Conciliatory manner on my part, that they all
                                                  combine to show me marked attention. In fine,
                                                  while avoiding churlishness to anyone, I do not
                                                  curry favour with the populace or relax any
                                                  principle; but my whole course of conduct is so
                                                  carefully regulated, that, while exhibiting an
                                                  example of firmness to the Republic, in my own
                                                  private concerns—in view of the
                                                  instability of the loyalists, the hostility of the
                                                  disaffected, and the hatred of the disloyal
                                                  towards me—I employ a certain caution
                                                  and circumspection, and do not allow myself, after
                                                  all, to be involved in these new friendships so
                                                  far but that the famous refrain of the cunning

                                                  supply the remedy you require. For that decree of
                                                  the senate was passed with the greatest unanimity

                                                  For as to your seeing my name at  the
                                                  foot of the decree, you can ascertain from the
                                                  decree itself that the subject put to the vote at
                                                  the time was a different one, and that this clause
                                                  about ""free peoples"" was added without good
                                                  reason. It was done by P. Servilius the younger,,insert_note_188,20,who
                                                  delivered his vote among the last, but it cannot
                                                  be altered after such an interval of time.
                                                  Accordingly, the meetings, which at first were
                                                  crowded, have long ceased to be held. If you have
                                                  been able, notwithstanding, by your insinuating
                                                  address to get a trifle of money out of the
                                                  Sicyonians, I wish you would let me know.,insert_note_192,21,I have sent

                                                  Attic like yourself seems to be un-Greek or
                                                  unscholarly, I shall not say as Lucullus said to
                                                  you (at,Panhormus,, was it not?) about his own
                                                  history, that he had interspersed certain
                                                  barbarisms and solecisms for the express purpose
                                                  of proving that it was the work of a Roman. No, if
                                                  there is anything of that sort in my book, it will
                                                  be without my knowledge and against my will. When
                                                  I have finished the Latin version I will send it
                                                  to you; and thirdly, you may expect a poem on the
                                                  subject, for I would not have any method of
                                                  celebrating my praise omitted by myself. In this
                                                  regard pray do not quote ""Who will praise his
                                                  sire?"",insert_note_200,22,For if there is anything in the world to
                                                  be preferred to this, let it receive its due meed
                                                  of praise, and I mine of blame for not selecting
                                                  another theme for my praise. However, what I write
                                                  is not panegyric but history. My brother Quintus
                                                  clears himself to me in a letter, and asserts that
                                                  he has never said a disparaging word of you  to anyone. But this we must discuss face
                                                  to face with the greatest care and earnestness:
                                                  only do come to see me again at last! This

                                                  exactly the sort of man which your letter to me
                                                  had described.,15 March.,,,XXV (A I, 20),,TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS),,ROME,, 13 MAY,,On my return to,Rome,from my villa at,Pompeii,on the
                                                  12th of May, our friend Cincius handed me your
                                                  letter dated 13th February. It is this letter of
                                                  yours which I will now proceed to answer. And
                                                  first let me say how glad I am that you have fully
                                                  understood my appreciation of you;,insert_note_232,23,and next how excessively rejoiced I
                                                  am that you have been so extremely reasonable in
                                                  regard to those particulars in which you thought,insert_note_236,24,that I and mine had behaved unkindly, or
                                                  with insufficient consideration for your feelings:
                                                  and this I regard as a proof of no common
                                                  affection, and of the most excellent judgment and
                                                  wisdom. Wherefore, since you have written to me in
                                                  a tone so delightful, considerate, friendly and
                                                  kind, that I not only have no call to press you
                                                  any farther, but can never even hope to meet from
                                                  you or any other man with so much gentleness and
                                                  good nature, I think the very best course I can
                                                  pursue is not to say another word on the subject
                                                  in my letters. When we meet, if the occasion
                                                  should arise, we will discuss it together. As to
                                                  what you say about politics, your suggestions
                                                  indeed  are both affectionate and
                                                  wise, and the course you suggest does not differ
                                                  substantially from my own policy—for I
                                                  must neither budge an inch from the position
                                                  imposed upon me by my rank, nor must I without
                                                  forces of my own enter the lines of another, while
                                                  that other, whom you mention in your letter, has
                                                  nothing large-minded about him, nothing lofty,
                                                  —nothing which is not abject and
                                                  time-serving. However, the course I took was,
                                                  after all, perhaps not ill-calculated for securing
                                                  the tranquillity of my own life; but, by heaven, I
                                                  did greater service to the Republic than, by
                                                  suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, I did to
                                                  myself, when I brought conviction home to the
                                                  wavering mind of a man of the most splendid
                                                  fortune, influence and popularity, and induced him
                                                  to disappoint the disloyal and praise my acts. Now
                                                  if I had been forced to sacrifice consistency in
                                                  this transaction, I should not have thought
                                                  anything worth that price; but the fact is that I
                                                  have so worked the whole business, that I did not
                                                  seem to be less consistent from my complacency to
                                                  him, but that he appeared to gain in character by
                                                  his approbation of me. In everything else I am so
                                                  acting, and shall continue so to act, as to
                                                  prevent my seeming to have done what I did do by
                                                  mere chance. My friends the loyalists, the men at

                                                  still stand by my ancient creed. However, please
                                                  consider this, that since the death of Catulus I

                                                  till we meet. But from the senate-house nothing
                                                  shall ever tear me: either because that course is
                                                  the right one, or because it is most to my
                                                  interests, or because I am far from being
                                                  dissatisfied with the estimation in which I am
                                                  held by the senate.  As to the
                                                  Sicyonians, as I wrote to you before,,insert_note_258,28,there is
                                                  not much to be hoped for in the senate. For there
                                                  is no one now to lay a complaint before it.
                                                  Therefore, if you are waiting for that, you will
                                                  find it a tedious business. Fight some other way
                                                  if you can. At the time the decree was passed no
                                                  one noticed who would be affected by it, and
                                                  besides the rank and file of the senators voted in
                                                  a great hurry for that clause. For cancelling the
                                                  senatorial decree the time is not yet ripe,
                                                  because there are none to complain of it, and
                                                  because also many are glad to have it so, some
                                                  from spite, some from a notion of its equity. Your
                                                  friend Metellus is an admirable consul: I have
                                                  only one fault to find with him—he
                                                  doesn't receive the news from,Gaul,of the
                                                  restoration of peace with much pleasure. He wants
                                                  a triumph, I suppose. I could have wished a little
                                                  less of that sort of thing: in other respects he
                                                  is splendid. But the son of Aulus behaves in such
                                                  a way, that his consulship is not a consulship but
                                                  a stigma on our friend Magnus. Of my writings I
                                                  send you my consulship in Greek completed. I have
                                                  handed that book to L. Cossinius. My Latin works I
                                                  think you like, but as a Greek you envy this Greek
                                                  book. If others write treatises on the subject I
                                                  will send them to you, but I assure you that, as
                                                  soon as they have read mine, somehow or other they
                                                  become slack. To return to my own affairs, L.
                                                  Papirius Paetus, an excellent man and an admirer
                                                  of mine, has presented me with the books left him
                                                  by Servius Claudius. As your friend Cincius told
                                                  me that I could take them without breaking the,lex,,Cincia,,,insert_note_273,29,I told
                                                  him that I should have great pleasure in accepting
                                                  them, if he brought them to,Italy,. Wherefore, as
                                                  you love me, as you know that I love you, do try
                                                  by means of friends, clients, guests, or even your
                                                  freedmen or slaves, to prevent the loss of a
                                                  single leaf. For I am in urgent need of the Greek
                                                  books which I suspect, and of the Latin books
                                                  which I know, that he left: and more and more
                                                  every day I find repose in such studies every
                                                  moment left to me from my labours in the forum.
                                                  You will, I say, do me a very great favour, if you
                                                  will be as zealous in this matter as you ever are
                                                  in matters in which you suppose me to feel  strongly; and Paetus's own affairs I
                                                  recommend to your kindness, for which he thanks
                                                  you extremely. A prompt visit from yourself is a

                                                  the way of M. Metellus's gladiators, your boy met
                                                  me, and delivered to me a letter from you and a
                                                  history of my consulship written in Greek.,insert_note_303,30,This made me glad that I had some time
                                                  before delivered to L. Cossinius a book, also
                                                  written in Greek, on the same subject, to take to
                                                  you. For if I had read yours first you might have
                                                  said that I had pilfered from you. Although your
                                                  essay (which I have read with pleasure) seemed to
                                                  me just a trifle rough and bald, yet its very
                                                  neglect of ornament is an ornament in itself, as
                                                  women were once thought to have the best perfume
                                                  who used none. My book, on the other hand, has
                                                  exhausted the whole of Isocrates's unguent case,
                                                  and all the paint-boxes of his pupils, and even
                                                  Aristotle's colours. This, as you tell me in

                                                  ventured to send it to you until I had slowly and
                                                  fastidiously revised it. However, Posidonius, in
                                                  his letter of acknowledgment from,Rhodes,, says that as
                                                  he read my memoir, which I had sent him with a
                                                  view to his writing on the same subject with more
                                                  elaboration, he was not only not incited to write,
                                                  but absolutely made afraid to do so. In a word, I
                                                  have routed the Greeks. Accordingly, as a general
                                                  rule, those who were pressing me for material to
                                                  work up, have now ceased to bother me. Pray, if
                                                  you like the book, see to there being copies at,Athens,and other Greek towns,insert_note_323,32,for it may
                                                  possibly throw some lustre on my actions. As for
                                                  my poor speeches, I will send you both those you
                                                  ask for and some more also, since what I write to

                                                  that your fellow citizen Demosthenes gained his
                                                  reputation, and because it was by withdrawing from
                                                  the mere controversial and forensic style of
                                                  oratory that he acquired the character of a

                                                  should have speeches that may properly be called,consular,. Of these are, first, one
                                                  delivered on the 1st of January in the senate, a
                                                  second to the people on the agrarian law, a third
                                                  on Otho, a fourth for Rabirius, a fifth on the
                                                  Sons of the Proscribed, a sixth when I declined a
                                                  province in public meeting, a seventh when I
                                                  allowed Catiline to escape, which I delivered the
                                                  day after Catiline fled, a ninth in public meeting
                                                  on the day that the Allobroges made their
                                                  revelation, a tenth in the senate on the 5th of

                                                  whole cycle I will see that you have. And since
                                                  you like my writings as well as my actions, from

                                                  done and what I have said—or you should

                                                  why I urge you to come home, and at the same time
                                                  you intimate that you are hampered by business
                                                  affairs, and yet say that you will nevertheless
                                                  hasten back, not only if it is needful, but even
                                                  if I desire it. Well, there is certainly no
                                                  absolute necessity, yet I do think you might plan
                                                  the periods of your tour somewhat more
                                                  conveniently. Your absence is too prolonged,

                                                  while yet I cannot enjoy your society,  nor you mine. For the present there is peace,
                                                  but if my young friend Puncher's,insert_note_336,34,madness found
                                                  means to advance a little farther, I should

                                                  and will continue to do so. Need I say more? He is

                                                  thought, naturally an honest man. That person,
                                                  however, makes no disguise, but avowedly desires
                                                  to be elected tribune. But when the matter was
                                                  mooted in the senate, I cut the fellow to pieces,
                                                  and taunted him with his changeableness in seeking
                                                  the tribuneship at,Rome,after having given out at Hera,
                                                  in,Sicily,,,insert_note_348,35,that he
                                                  was a candidate for the aedileship; and went on to
                                                  say that we needn't much trouble ourselves, for
                                                  that he would not be permitted to ruin the
                                                  Republic any more as a plebeian, than patricians
                                                  like him had been allowed to do so in my
                                                  consulship. Presently, on his saying that he had
                                                  completed the journey from the straits in seven
                                                  days, and that it was impossible for anyone to
                                                  have gone out to meet him, and that he had entered
                                                  the city by night,,insert_note_352,36,and making a great parade of
                                                  this in a public meeting, I remarked that that was
                                                  nothing new for him: seven days from,Sicily,to,Rome,, three hours
                                                  from,Rome,to lnteramna !,insert_note_368,37,Entered by night, did he? so he did before! No one
                                                  went to meet him? neither did anyone on the other
                                                  occasion, exactly when it should have been done!
                                                  In short, I bring our young upstart to his
                                                  bearings, not only by a set and serious speech,
                                                  but also by repartees of this sort. Accordingly, I
                                                  have come now to rally him and jest with him in
                                                  quite a familiar manner. For instance, when we
                                                  were escorting a candidate, he asked me ""whether I
                                                  had been accustomed to secure Sicilians places at
                                                  the gladiatorial shows?"" "" No,"" said I. ""Well, I
                                                  intend to start the practice,"" said he, ""as their
                                                  new patron; but my sister,,insert_note_372,38,who has the control of such a large
                                                  part of the consul's space, won't give me more
                                                  than a single foot."" ""Don't grumble,"" said I,
                                                  ""about one of your sister's feet; you may lift the
                                                  other also."" A jest, you will say, unbecoming to a
                                                  consular. I confess it, but I detest that
                                                  woman—so unworthy of a consul. For “
                                                  A shrew she is and with her husband jars,,” and not only with Metellus, but also with
                                                  Fabius,,insert_note_378,39,because she is annoyed at their interference in
                                                  this business.,insert_note_382,40,You ask about the
                                                  agrarian law: it has completely lost all interest,
                                                  I think. You rather chide me, though gently, about
                                                  my intimacy with Pompey. I would not have you
                                                  think that I have made friends with him for my own
                                                  protection; but things had come to such a pass
                                                  that, if by any chance we had quarreled, there
                                                  would inevitably have been violent dissensions in
                                                  the state. And in taking precautions and making
                                                  provision against that, I by no means swerved from
                                                  my well-known loyalist policy, but my object was
                                                  to make him more of a loyalist and induce him to
                                                  drop somewhat of his time-serving vacillation: and
                                                  he, let me assure you, now speaks in much higher
                                                  terms of my achievements (against which many had
                                                  tried to incite him) than of his own. He testifies
                                                  that while he served the state well, I preserved
                                                  it. What if I even make a better citizen of
                                                  Caesar,,insert_note_386,41,who has now
                                                  the wind full in his sails—am I doing so
                                                  poor a service to the Republic? Furthermore, if
                                                  there was no one to envy me, if all, as they ought
                                                  to be, were my supporters, nevertheless a
                                                  preference should still be given to a treatment
                                                  that would cure the diseased parts of the state,
                                                  rather than to the use of the knife. As it is,
                                                  however, since the knighthood, which I once
                                                  stationed on the slope of  the
                                                  Capitoline,,insert_note_390,42,with you as their
                                                  standard-bearer and leader, has deserted the
                                                  senate, and since our leading men think themselves
                                                  in a seventh heaven, if there are bearded mullets
                                                  in their fish-ponds that will come to hand for
                                                  food, and neglect everything else, do not you
                                                  think that I am doing no mean service if I secure
                                                  that those who have the power, should not have the
                                                  will, to do any harm? As for our friend Cato, you
                                                  do not love him more than I do: but after all,
                                                  with the very best intentions and the most
                                                  absolute honesty, he sometimes does harm to the
                                                  Republic. He speaks and votes as though he were in
                                                  the Republic of Plato, not in the scum of Romulus.
                                                  What could be fairer than that a man should be
                                                  brought to trial who has taken a bribe for his
                                                  verdict? Cato voted for this: the senate agreed
                                                  with him. The equites declared war on the senate,
                                                  not on me, for I voted against it. What could be a
                                                  greater piece of impudence than the equites
                                                  renouncing the obligations of their contract? Yet
                                                  for the sake of keeping the friendship of the
                                                  order it was necessary to submit to the loss. Cato
                                                  resisted and carried his point. Accordingly,
                                                  though we have now had the spectacle of a consul
                                                  thrown into prison,,insert_note_394,43,of riots again and
                                                  again stirred up, not one of those moved a finger
                                                  to help, with whose support I and the consuls that
                                                  immediately followed me were accustomed to defend
                                                  the Republic. ""Well, but,"" say you, ""are we to pay
                                                  them for their support?"" What are we to do if we
                                                  can't get it on any other terms? Are we to be

                                                  vexed than you. For it is the result of a fault on
                                                  my part, against which you had protested both in
                                                  conversation at the moment of your departure, and
                                                  in letters since, that your successor was not
                                                  named last year. In this, while consulting for the
                                                  interests of our allies, and resisting the
                                                  shameless conduct of some merchants, and while
                                                  seeking the increase of our reputation by your
                                                  virtues, I acted unwisely, especially as I made it
                                                  possible for that second year to entail a third.
                                                  And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it
                                                  lies with your wisdom and kindness to remedy it,
                                                  and to see that my imprudence is turned to
                                                  advantage by your careful performance of your
                                                  duties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every
                                                  direction to earn men's good word, not with a view
                                                  to rival others, but henceforth to surpass
                                                  yourself, if you rouse your whole mind and your
                                                  every thought and care to the ambition of gaining
                                                  a superior reputation in all respects, believe me,
                                                  one year added to your labour will bring us, nay,
                                                  our posterity also, a joy of many years' duration.
                                                  Wherefore I begin by entreating you not to let
                                                  your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to allow
                                                  yourself to be overpowered by the magnitude of the
                                                  business as though by a wave; but, on the
                                                  contrary, to stand upright and keep your footing,
                                                  or even advance to meet the flood of affairs. For
                                                  you are not administering a department of the
                                                  state, in which fortune reigns supreme, but one in
                                                  which a well-considered policy and an attention to
                                                  business are the most important things. But if I
                                                  had seen you receiving the prolongation of a
                                                  command in a great and dangerous war, I should
                                                  have trembled in spirit, because I should have  known that the dominion of fortune over
                                                  us had been at the same time prolonged. As it is,
                                                  however, a department of the state has been
                                                  entrusted to you in which fortune occupies no
                                                  part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and
                                                  which appears to me to depend entirely on your
                                                  virtue and self-control. We have no reason to
                                                  fear, as far as I know, any designs of our
                                                  enemies, any actual fighting in the field, any
                                                  revolts of allies, any default in the tribute or
                                                  in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army:
                                                  things which have very often befallen the wisest
                                                  of men in such a way, that they have been no more
                                                  able to get the better of the assault of been
                                                  granted profound peace, a dead calm: yet if the
                                                  pilot fortune, than the best of pilots a violent
                                                  tempest. You have falls asleep, it may even so
                                                  overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may
                                                  give him positive pleasure. For your province
                                                  consists, in the first place, of allies of a race
                                                  which; of all the world, is the most civilized;
                                                  and, in the second place, of Citizens, who, either
                                                  as being,publicani,are very closely connected with me, or, as being
                                                  traders who have made money, think that they owe
                                                  the security of their property to my consulship.

        But it may be
                                                  said that among even such men as these there occur
                                                  serious disputes, many wrongful acts are
                                                  committed, and hotly contested litigation is the
                                                  result. As though I ever thought that you had no
                                                  trouble to contend with! I know that the trouble
                                                  is exceedingly great, and such as demands the very
                                                  greatest prudence; but remember that it is
                                                  prudence much more than fortune on which, in my
                                                  opinion, the result of your trouble depends. For
                                                  what trouble is it to govern those over whom you
                                                  are set, if you do but govern yourself? That may
                                                  be a great and difficult task to others, and
                                                  indeed it is most difficult: to you it has always
                                                  been the easiest thing in the world, and indeed
                                                  ought to be so, for your natural disposition is
                                                  such that, even without discipline, it appears
                                                  capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has,
                                                  in fact, been applied that might educate the most
                                                  faulty of characters. But while you resist, as you
                                                  do, money, pleasure, and every kind of desire
                                                  yourself, there will, I am to be told, be a risk
                                                  of your not being able to suppress some fraudulent
                                                  banker or some rather over-extortionate
                                                  tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will
                                                  think, as they behold the innocence of  your life, that one of the heroes of their
                                                  history, or a demigod from heaven, has come down
                                                  into the province. And this I say, not to induce
                                                  you to act thus, but to make you glad that you are
                                                  acting or have acted so. It is a splendid thing to
                                                  have been three years in supreme power in,Asia,without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery,
                                                  slave, anyone's good looks, or any offer of
                                                  money—all of which are plentiful in your
                                                  province—to cause you to swerve from the
                                                  most absolute honesty and purity of life. What can
                                                  be imagined so striking or so desirable as that a
                                                  virtue, a command over the passions, a
                                                  self-control such as yours, are not remaining in
                                                  darkness and obscurity, but have been set in the
                                                  broad daylight of,Asia,, before the eyes of a famous
                                                  province, and in the hearing of all nations and
                                                  peoples? That the inhabitants are not being ruined
                                                  by your progresses, drained by your charges,
                                                  agitated by your approach? That there is the
                                                  liveliest joy, public and private, wheresoever you
                                                  come, the city regarding you as a protector and
                                                  not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not
                                                  a plunderer? 
      [,3,],But in these matters I am sure that mere
                                                  experience has by this time taught you that it is
                                                  by no means sufficient to have these virtues
                                                  yourself, but that you must keep your eyes open
                                                  and vigilant, in order that in the guardianship of
                                                  your province you may be considered to vouch to
                                                  the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for
                                                  yourself alone, but for all the subordinates of
                                                  your government. However, you have in the persons

                                                  first; who, I think, particularly as he is a

                                                  conform to the policy and principles which you lay
                                                  down. But should any one of these adopt a lower
                                                  standard of conduct, you should tolerate such
                                                  behaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in
                                                  his private capacity, of the rules by which he was
                                                  bound, but not if it goes to the extent of
                                                  employing for gain the authority which you granted
                                                  him as a promotion. For I am far from thinking,
                                                  especially since the moral sentiments of the day
                                                  are so much inclined to excessive laxity and
                                                  self-seeking, that you should investigate every
                                                  case of petty misconduct, and thoroughly examine
                                                  every one of these persons; but that you should
                                                  regulate your confidence by the trustworthiness of
                                                  its recipient. And among such persons you will
                                                  have to vouch for those whom the Republic has
                                                  itself given you as companions and assistants in
                                                  public affairs, at least within the limits which I
                                                  have before laid down. 
      [,4,],In the case, however, of those of your personal
                                                  staff or official attendants whom you have
                                                  yourself selected to be about you—who
                                                  are usually spoken of as a kind of praetor's
                                                  cohort—we must vouch, not only for their
                                                  acts, but even for their words. But those you have
                                                  with you are the sort of men of whom you may
                                                  easily be fond when they are acting rightly, and
                                                  whom you may very easily check when they show
                                                  insufficient regard for your reputation. By these,
                                                  when you were raw to the work, your frank
                                                  disposition might possibly have been
                                                  deceived—for the better a man is the
                                                  less easily does he suspect others of being
                                                  bad—now, however, let this third year
                                                  witness an integrity as perfect as the two former,
                                                  but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that
                                                  only which you are supposed to listen to; don't
                                                  let your ears be open to whispered falsehoods and
                                                  interested suggestions. Don't let your signet ring
                                                  be a mere implement, but, as it were, your second
                                                  self: not the minister of another's will, but a
                                                  witness of your own. Let your marshal hold the
                                                  rank which our ancestors wished him to hold, who,
                                                  looking upon this place as not one of profit, but
                                                  of labour and duty, scarcely ever conferred it
                                                  upon any but their freedmen, whom they indeed
                                                  controlled almost as absolutely as their slaves.
                                                  Let the lictor be the dispenser of your clemency,
                                                  not his own; and let the fasces and axes which
                                                  they carry before you constitute ensigns rather of
                                                  rank than of power. Let it, in fact, 
                                                  be known to the whole province that the life,
                                                  children, fame, and fortunes of all over whom you
                                                  preside are exceedingly dear to you. Finally, let
                                                  it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be
                                                  hostile not only to those who have accepted a
                                                  bribe, but to those also who have given it. And,
                                                  indeed, no one will give anything, if it is made
                                                  quite clear that nothing is usually obtained from
                                                  you through those who pretend to be very
                                                  influential with you. Not, however, that the
                                                  object of this discourse is to make you over-harsh
                                                  or suspicious towards your staff. For if any of
                                                  them in the course of the last two years has never
                                                  fallen under suspicion of rapacity, as I am told
                                                  about Caesius and Chaerippus and
                                                  Labeo—and think it true, because I know
                                                  them—there is no authority, I think,
                                                  which may not be entrusted to them, and no
                                                  confidence which may not be placed in them with
                                                  the utmost propriety, and in anyone else like
                                                  them. But if there is anyone of whom you have
                                                  already had reason to doubt, or concerning whom
                                                  you have made some discovery, in such a man place
                                                  no confidence, intrust him with no particle of
                                                  your reputation. V. If, however, you have found in
                                                  the province itself anyone, hitherto unknown to
                                                  us, who has made his way into intimacy with you,
                                                  take care how much confidence you repose in him;
                                                  not that there may not be many good provincials,
                                                  but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be
                                                  positive. For everyone's real character is covered
                                                  by many wrappings of pretence and is concealed by
                                                  a kind of veil: face, eyes, expression very often
                                                  lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can
                                                  you expect to find in that class,insert_note_655,71,any who,
                                                  while foregoing for the sake of money all from
                                                  which we can scarcely tear ourselves away,,insert_note_659,72,will yet love you sincerely and not merely
                                                  pretend to do so from interested motives? I think,
                                                  indeed, it is a hard task to find such men,
                                                  especially if we notice that the same persons care
                                                  nothing for almost any man out of office, yet
                                                  always with one consent show affection for the
                                                  praetors. But of this class, if by chance you have
                                                  discovered any one to be fonder of
                                                  you—for it may so happen—than
                                                  of your office, such a man indeed gladly admit
                                                  upon  your list of friends: but if you
                                                  fail to perceive that, there is no Class of people
                                                  you must be more on your guard against admitting
                                                  to intimacy, just because they are acquainted with
                                                  all the ways of making money, do everything for
                                                  the sake of it, and have no consideration for the
                                                  reputation of a man with whom they are not
                                                  destined to pass their lives. And even among the
                                                  Greeks themselves you must be on your guard
                                                  against admitting close intimacies, except in the
                                                  case of the very few, if such are to be found, who
                                                  are worthy of ancient,Greece,. As things now stand, indeed,
                                                  too many of them are untrustworthy, false, and
                                                  schooled by long servitude in the arts of
                                                  extravagant adulation. My advice is that these men
                                                  should all be entertained with courtesy, but that
                                                  close ties of hospitality or friendship should
                                                  only be formed with the best of them: excessive
                                                  intimacies with them are not very
                                                  trustworthy—for they do not venture to
                                                  oppose our wishes—and they are not only
                                                  jealous of our countrymen, but of their own as
                                                  well. VI. And now, considering the caution and
                                                  care that I would show in matters of this
                                                  kind—in which I fear I may be somewhat
                                                  over-severe—what do you suppose my
                                                  sentiments are in regard to slaves? Upon these we
                                                  ought to keep a hold in all places, but especially
                                                  in the provinces. On this head many rules may be
                                                  laid down, but this is at once the shortest and
                                                  most easily maintained—that they should
                                                  behave during your progresses in,Asia,as though you
                                                  were travelling on the Appian way, and not suppose
                                                  that it makes any difference whether they have
                                                  arrived at,Tralles,or,Formiae,. But if,
                                                  again, any one of your slaves is conspicuously
                                                  trustworthy, employ him in your domestic and
                                                  private affairs; but in affairs pertaining to your
                                                  office as governor, or in any department of the
                                                  state, do not let him lay a finger. For many
                                                  things which may, with perfect propriety, be
                                                  in-trusted to slaves, must yet not be so
                                                  entrusted, for the sake of avoiding talk and
                                                  hostile remark. But my discourse, I know not how,
                                                  has slipped into the didactic vein, though that is
                                                  not what I proposed to myself originally. For what
                                                  right have I to be laying down rules for one who,
                                                  I am fully aware, in this subject especially, is
                                                  not my inferior in wisdom, while in experience he
                                                  is even my superior? Yet, after all, if your
                                                  actions had the additional weight of my approval,
                                                  I  thought that they would seem more
                                                  satisfactory to yourself. Wherefore, let these be
                                                  the foundations on which your public character
                                                  rests: first and foremost your own honesty and
                                                  self-control, then the scrupulous conduct of all
                                                  your staff, the exceedingly cautious and careful
                                                  selection in regard to intimacies with provincials
                                                  and Greeks, the strict and unbending government of
                                                  your slaves. These are creditable even in the
                                                  conduct of our private and everyday business: in
                                                  such an important government, where morals are so
                                                  debased and the province has such a corrupting
                                                  influence, they must needs seem divine. Such
                                                  principles and conduct on your part are sufficient
                                                  to justify the strictness which you have displayed
                                                  in some acts of administration, owing to which I
                                                  have encountered certain personal disputes with
                                                  great satisfaction, unless, indeed, you suppose me
                                                  to be annoyed by the complaints of a fellow like
                                                  Paconius—who is not even a Greek, but in
                                                  reality a Mysian or Phrygian—or by the
                                                  words of Tuscenius, a madman and a knave, from
                                                  whose abominable jaws you snatched the fruits of a
                                                  most infamous piece of extortion with the most
                                                  complete justice. 
      [,7,],These and similar instances of your strict
                                                  administration in your province we shall find
                                                  difficulty in justifying, unless they are
                                                  accompanied by the most perfect integrity:
                                                  wherefore let there be the greatest strictness in
                                                  your administration of justice, provided only that
                                                  it is never varied from favour, but is kept up
                                                  with impartiality. But it is of little avail that
                                                  justice is administered by yourself with
                                                  impartiality and care, unless the same is done by
                                                  those to whom you have entrusted any portion of
                                                  this duty. And, indeed, in my view there is no
                                                  very great variety of business in the government
                                                  of,Asia,:
                                                  the entire province mainly depends on the
                                                  administration of justice. In it we have the whole
                                                  theory of government, especially of provincial
                                                  government, clearly displayed: all that a governor
                                                  has to do is to show consistency and firmness
                                                  enough, not only td resist favouritism, but even
                                                  the suspicion of it. To this also must be added
                                                  courtesy in listening to pleaders, consideration
                                                  in pronouncing a decision, and painstaking efforts
                                                  to convince suitors of its justice, and to answer
                                                  their arguments. It is by such habits that C.
                                                  Octavius has recently made himself 
                                                  very popular;,insert_note_688,73,in whose court, for the first time,,insert_note_692,74,the lictor did not
                                                  interfere, and the marshal kept silence, while
                                                  every suitor spoke as often and as long as he
                                                  chose. In which conduct he would perhaps have been
                                                  thought over-lax, had it not been that this laxity
                                                  enabled him to maintain the following in stance of
                                                  severity. The partisans of Sulla were forced to
                                                  restore what they had taken by violence and
                                                  terrorism. Those who had made inequitable decrees;
                                                  while in office, were now as private citizens
                                                  forced to submit to the principles they had
                                                  established. This strictness on his part would
                                                  have been thought harsh, had it not been rendered
                                                  palatable by many sweetening influences of
                                                  courtesy. But if this gentleness was sufficient to
                                                  make him popular at,Rome,, where there is such haughtiness
                                                  of spirit, such unrestrained liberty, such
                                                  unlimited licence of individuals, and, in fine, so
                                                  many magistrates, so many means of obtaining
                                                  protection, such vast power in the hands of the
                                                  popular assembly, and such influence exercised by
                                                  the senate, how welcome must a praetor's courtesy
                                                  be in,Asia,, in which there is such a
                                                  numerous body of citizens and allies, so many
                                                  cities, so many communities, all hanging on one
                                                  man's nod, and in which there are no means of
                                                  protection, no one to whom to make a complaint, no
                                                  senate, no popular assembly! Wherefore it requires
                                                  an exalted character, a man who is not only
                                                  equitable from natural impulse, but who has also
                                                  been trained by study and the refinements of a
                                                  liberal education, so to conduct himself while in
                                                  the possession of such immense power, that those
                                                  over whom he rules should not feel the want of any
                                                  other power. 
      [,8,],Take the case of the famous Cyrus, portrayed by
                                                  Xenophon, not as an historical character, but as a
                                                  model of righteous government, the serious dignity
                                                  of whose character is represented by that
                                                  philosopher as combined with a peculiar courtesy.
                                                  And, indeed, it is not without reason that our
                                                  hero Africanus used perpetually to have those
                                                  books in his hands, for there is no duty
                                                  pertaining to a careful and equitable governor
                                                  which is not to be found in them. Well, if he  cultivated those qualities, though never
                                                  destined to be in a private station, how carefully
                                                  ought those to maintain them to whom power is
                                                  given with the understanding that it must be
                                                  surrendered, and given by laws under whose
                                                  authority they must once more come? In my opinion
                                                  all who govern others are bound to regard as the
                                                  object of all their actions the greatest happiness
                                                  of the governed. That this is your highest object,
                                                  and has been so since you first landed in,Asia,, has
                                                  been published abroad by Consistent rumour and the
                                                  conversation of all. It is, let me add, not only
                                                  the duty of one who governs allies and citizens,
                                                  but even of one who governs slaves and dumb
                                                  animals, to serve the interests and advantage of
                                                  those under him. In this point I notice that
                                                  everyone agrees that you take the greatest pains:
                                                  no new debt is being contracted by the states,
                                                  while many have been relieved by you from a heavy
                                                  and long-standing one. Several cities that had
                                                  become dilapidated and almost
                                                  deserted—of which one was the most
                                                  famous state in,Ionia,, the other in,Caria,, Samus and
                                                  Halicarnassus—have been given a new life
                                                  by you: there is no party fighting, no civil
                                                  strife in the towns: you take care that the
                                                  government of the states is administered by the
                                                  best class of citizens: brigandage is abolished in,Mysia,;
                                                  murder suppressed in many districts; peace is
                                                  established throughout the province; and not only
                                                  the robberies usual on highways and in country
                                                  places, but those more numerous and more serious
                                                  ones in towns and temples, have been completely
                                                  stopped: the fame, fortunes, and repose of the
                                                  rich have been relieved of that most oppressive
                                                  instrument of praetorial rapacity-vexatious
                                                  prosecution; the expenses and tribute of the
                                                  states are made to fall with equal weight on all
                                                  who live in the territories of those states:
                                                  access to you is as easy as possible: your ears
                                                  are open to the complaints of all: no man's want
                                                  of means or want of friends excludes him, I don't
                                                  say from access to you in public and on the
                                                  tribunal, but -even from your house and chamber:
                                                  in a word, throughout your government there is no
                                                  harshness or cruelty-everywhere clemency,
                                                  mildness, and kindness reign supreme. 
      [,9,],What an immense benefit, again, have you done
                                                  in having liberated,Asia,from the tribute exacted by the
                                                  aediles, a measure which cost me some violent
                                                  controversies! For  if one of our
                                                  nobles complains openly that by your edict, ""No
                                                  moneys shall be voted for the games,"" you have
                                                  robbed him of 200 sestertia, what a vast sum of
                                                  money would have been paid, had a grant been made
                                                  to the Credit of every magistrate who held games,
                                                  as had become the regular custom! However, I
                                                  stopped these Complaints by taking up this
                                                  position—what they think of it in,Asia,I
                                                  don't know, in,Rome,it meets with no little approval
                                                  and praise—I refused to accept a sum of
                                                  money which the states had decreed for a temple
                                                  and monument in our honour, though they had done
                                                  so with the greatest enthusiasm in view both of my
                                                  services and of your most valuable benefactions;
                                                  and though the law contained a special and
                                                  distinct exception in these words, ""that it was
                                                  lawful to receive for temple or monument""; and
                                                  though again the money was not going to be thrown
                                                  away, but would be employed on decorating a
                                                  temple, and would thus appear to have been given
                                                  to the Roman people and gift in its favour, I
                                                  determined that I must not accept it, for the
                                                  immortal Gods rather than to myself—yet,
                                                  in spite of its having desert, law, and the wishes
                                                  of those who offered the this reason among others,
                                                  namely, to prevent those, to whom such an honour
                                                  was neither due nor legal, from being jealous.
                                                  Wherefore adhere with all your heart and soul to
                                                  the policy which you have hitherto
                                                  adopted—that of being devoted to those
                                                  whom the senate and people of,Rome,have committed
                                                  and entrusted to your honour and authority, of
                                                  doing your best to protect them, and of desiring
                                                  their greatest happiness. Even if the lot had made
                                                  you governor of Africans, or Spaniards, or
                                                  Gauls—uncivilized and barbarous
                                                  nations—it would still have been your
                                                  duty as a man of feeling to consult for their
                                                  interests and advantage, and to have contributed
                                                  to their safety. But when we rule over a race of
                                                  men in which civilization not only exists, but
                                                  from which it is believed to have spread to
                                                  others, we are bound to repay them, above all
                                                  things, what we received from them. For I shall
                                                  not be ashamed to go so far—especially
                                                  as my life and achievements have been such as to
                                                  exclude any suspicion of sloth or
                                                  frivolity—as to confess that, whatever I
                                                  have accomplished, I have accomplished by means of
                                                  those studies and principles which have been
                                                  transmitted to us in Greek literature and schools
                                                  of thought. Wherefore, over and above the  general good faith which is due to all
                                                  men, I think we are in a special sense under an
                                                  obligation to that nation, to put in practice what
                                                  it has taught us among the very men by whose
                                                  maxims we have been brought out of barbarism.
                                                  
      [,10,],And indeed Plato, the fountain-head of genius
                                                  and learning, thought that states would only be
                                                  happy when scholars and philosophers began being
                                                  their rulers, or when those who were their rulers
                                                  had devoted all their attention to learning and
                                                  philosophy. It was plainly this union of power and
                                                  philosophy that in his opinion might prove the
                                                  salvation of states. And this perhaps has at
                                                  length fallen to the fortune of the whole empire:
                                                  certainly it has in the present instance to your
                                                  province, to have a man in supreme power in it,
                                                  who has from boyhood spent the chief part of his
                                                  zeal and time in imbibing the principles of
                                                  philosophy, virtue, and humanity. Wherefore be
                                                  careful that this third year, which has been added
                                                  to your labour, may be thought a prolongation of
                                                  prosperity to,Asia,. And since,Asia,was more
                                                  fortunate in retaining you than I was in my
                                                  endeavour to bring you back, see that my regret is
                                                  softened by the exultation of the province. For if
                                                  you have displayed the very greatest activity in
                                                  earning honours such as, I think, have never been
                                                  paid to anyone else, much greater ought your
                                                  activity to be in preserving these honours. What I
                                                  for my part think of honours of that kind I have
                                                  told you in previous letters. I have always
                                                  regarded them, if given indiscriminately, as of
                                                  little value, if paid from interested motives, as
                                                  worthless: if, however, as in this case, they are
                                                  tributes to solid services on your part, I hold
                                                  you bound to take much pains in preserving them.
                                                  Since, then, you are exercising supreme power and
                                                  official authority in cities, in which you have

                                                  of your virtues, in all decisions, decrees, and
                                                  official acts consider what you owe to those warm
                                                  opinions entertained of you, to those verdicts on
                                                  your character, to those honours which have been
                                                  rendered you. And what you owe will be to consult
                                                  for the interests of all, to remedy men's
                                                  misfortunes, to provide for their safety, to
                                                  resolve that you will be both called and believed
                                                  to be the ""father of,Asia,.""

                                                  Republic by our means; if, on the other hand, we
                                                  comply with them in every case, we shall allow the
                                                  complete ruin of those whose interests, to say
                                                  nothing of their preservation, we are bound to
                                                  consult. This is the one difficulty, if we look
                                                  the thing fairly in the face, in your whole
                                                  government. For disinterested conduct on one's own
                                                  part, the suppression of all inordinate desires,
                                                  the keeping a check upon one's staff, courtesy in
                                                  hearing causes, in listening to and admitting
                                                  suitor—all this is rather a question of
                                                  credit than of difficulty: for it does not depend
                                                  on any special exertion, but rather on a mental
                                                  resolve and inclination. But how much bitterness
                                                  of feeling is caused to allies by that question of
                                                  the,publicani,we have
                                                  had reason to know in the case of citizens who,
                                                  when recently urging the removal of the port-dues
                                                  in,Italy,,
                                                  did not complain so much of the dues themselves,
                                                  as of certain extortionate conduct on the part of
                                                  the collectors. Wherefore, after hearing the
                                                  grievances of citizens in,Italy,, I can
                                                  comprehend what happens to allies in distant
                                                  lands. To conduct oneself in this matter in such a
                                                  way as to satisfy the,publicani,especially when contracts
                                                  have been undertaken at a loss, and yet to
                                                  preserve the allies from ruin, seems to demand a
                                                  virtue with something divine in it, I mean a
                                                  virtue like yours. To begin with, that they are
                                                  subject to tax at all, which is their greatest
                                                  grievance, ought not to be thought so by the
                                                  Greeks, because they were so subject by their own
                                                  laws without the Roman government. Again, they
                                                  cannot despise the word,publicanus,, for they have been unable
                                                  to pay the assessment according to Sulla's
                                                  poll-tax without the aid of the publican. But that
                                                  Greek,publicani,are
                                                  not more considerate in exacting the payment of
                                                  taxes than our own may be gathered from the fact
                                                  that the Caunii, and all the islands assigned to
                                                  the Rhodians by Sulla, recently appealed to the
                                                  protection of the senate, and petitioned to be
                                                  allowed to pay their tax to us rather than to the
                                                  Rhodians. Wherefore neither ought those to revolt
                                                  at the name of a,publicanus,who have always been subject
                                                  to tax, nor those to despise it who have been
                                                  unable to make up the tribute by themselves,  nor those to refuse his services who have
                                                  asked for them. At the same time let,Asia,reflect on
                                                  this, that if she were not under our government,
                                                  there is no calamity of foreign war or internal
                                                  strife from which she would be free. And since
                                                  that government cannot possibly be maintained
                                                  without taxes, she should be content to purchase
                                                  perpetual peace and tranquillity at the price of a
                                                  certain proportion of her products. 
      [,12,],But if they will fairly reconcile themselves to
                                                  the existence and name of publican, all the rest
                                                  may be made to appear to them in a less offensive
                                                  light by your skill and prudence. They may, in
                                                  making their bargains with the,publicani,, not have regard so much to
                                                  the exact conditions laid down by the censors as
                                                  to the convenience of settling the business and
                                                  freeing themselves from farther trouble. You also
                                                  may do, what you have done splendidly and are
                                                  still doing, namely, dwell on the high position of
                                                  the,publicani,, and on
                                                  your obligations to that order, in such a way
                                                  as—putting out of the question all
                                                  considerations of your,imperium,and the power of your official
                                                  authority and dignity—to reconcile the
                                                  Greeks with the,publicani,; and to beg of those, whom
                                                  you have served eminently well, and who owe you
                                                  everything, to suffer you by their compliance to
                                                  maintain and preserve the bonds which unite us
                                                  with the,publicani,.
                                                  But why do I address these exhortations to you,
                                                  who are not only capable of carrying them out of
                                                  your own accord without anyone's instruction, but
                                                  have already to a great extent thoroughly done so?
                                                  For the most respectable and important companies
                                                  do not cease offering me thanks daily, and this is
                                                  all the more gratifying to me because the Greeks
                                                  do the same. Now it is an achievement of great
                                                  difficulty to unite in feeling things which are
                                                  opposite in interests, aims, and, I had almost
                                                  said, in their very nature. But I have not written
                                                  all this to instruct you—for your wisdom
                                                  requires no man's instruction—but it has
                                                  been a pleasure to me while writing to set down
                                                  your virtues, though I have run to greater length
                                                  in this letter than I could have wished, or than I
                                                  thought I should. 
      [,13,],There is one thing on which I shall not cease
                                                  from giving you advice, nor will I, as far as in
                                                  me lies, allow your praise to be spoken of with a
                                                  reservation. For all who  come from
                                                  your province do make one reservation in the
                                                  extremely high praise which they bestow on your
                                                  virtue, integrity, and kindness—it is
                                                  that of sharpness of temper. That is a fault
                                                  which, even in our private and everyday life,
                                                  seems to indicate want of solidity and strength of
                                                  mind; but nothing, surely, can be more improper
                                                  than to combine harshness of temper with the
                                                  exercise of supreme power. Wherefore I will not
                                                  undertake to lay before you now what the greatest
                                                  philosophers say about anger, for I should not
                                                  wish to be tedious, and you can easily ascertain
                                                  it yourself from the writings of many of them: but
                                                  I don't think I ought to pass over what is the
                                                  essence of a letter, namely, that the recipient
                                                  should be informed of what he does not know. Well,
                                                  what nearly everybody reports to me is this: they
                                                  usually say that, as long as you are not out of
                                                  temper, nothing can be pleasanter than you are,
                                                  but that when some instance of dishonesty or
                                                  wrong-headedness has stirred you, your temper
                                                  rises to such a height that no one Can discover
                                                  any trace of your usual kindness. Wherefore, since
                                                  no mere desire for glory, but circumstances and
                                                  fortune have brought us upon a path of life which
                                                  makes it inevitable that men will always talk
                                                  about us, let us be on our guard, to the utmost of
                                                  our means and ability, that no glaring fault may
                                                  be alleged to have existed in us. And I am not now
                                                  urging, what is perhaps difficult in human nature
                                                  generally, and at our time of life especially,
                                                  that you should change your disposition and
                                                  suddenly pluck out a deeply-rooted habit, but I
                                                  give you this hint: if you cannot completely avoid
                                                  this failing, because your mind is surprised by
                                                  anger before cool calculation has been able to
                                                  prevent it, deliberately prepare yourself
                                                  beforehand, and daily reflect on the duty of
                                                  resisting anger, and that, when it moves your
                                                  heart most violently, it is just the time for
                                                  being most careful to restrain your tongue. And
                                                  that sometimes seems to me to be a. greater virtue
                                                  than not being angry at all. For the latter is not
                                                  always a mark of superiority to weakness, it is
                                                  sometimes the result of dullness; but to govern
                                                  temper and speech, however angry you may be, or
                                                  even to hold your tongue and keep your indignant
                                                  feelings and resentment under control, although it
                                                  may not be a proof of perfect wisdom, yet requires
                                                  no ordinary force of character. And, 
                                                  indeed, in this respect they tell me that you are
                                                  now much more gentle and less irritable. No
                                                  violent outbursts of indignation on your part, no
                                                  abusive words, no insulting language are reported
                                                  to me: which, while quite alien to culture and
                                                  refinement, are specially unsuited to high power
                                                  and place. For if your anger is implacable, it
                                                  amounts to extreme harshness; if easily appeased,
                                                  to extreme weakness. The latter, however, as a
                                                  choice of evils, is, after all, preferable to
                                                  harshness. 
      [,14,],But since your first year gave rise to most
                                                  talk in regard to this particular
                                                  complaint—I believe because the
                                                  wrong-doing, the covetousness, and the arrogance
                                                  of men came upon you as a surprise, and seemed to
                                                  you unbearable-while your second year was much
                                                  milder, because habit and refection, and, as I
                                                  think, my letters also, rendered you more tolerant
                                                  and gentle, the third ought to be so completely
                                                  reformed, as not to give even the smallest ground
                                                  for anyone to find fault. And here I go on to urge
                                                  upon you, not by way of exhortation or admonition,
                                                  but by brotherly entreaties, that you would set
                                                  your whole heart, care, and thought on the gaining
                                                  of praise from everybody and from every quarter.
                                                  If, indeed, our achievements were only the subject
                                                  of a moderate amount of talk and commendation,
                                                  nothing eminent, nothing beyond the practice of
                                                  others, would have been demanded of you. As it is,
                                                  however, owing to the brilliancy and magnitude of
                                                  the affairs in which we have been engaged, if we
                                                  do not obtain the very highest reputation from
                                                  your province, it seems scarcely possible for us
                                                  to avoid the most violent abuse. Our position is
                                                  such that all loyalists support us, but demand
                                                  also and expect from us every kind of activity and
                                                  virtue, while all the disloyal, seeing that we
                                                  have entered upon a lasting war with them, appear
                                                  contented with the very smallest excuse for
                                                  attacking us. Wherefore, since fortune has
                                                  allotted to you such a theatre as,Asia,, completely
                                                  packed with an audience, of immense size, of the
                                                  most refined judgment, and, moreover, naturally so
                                                  capable of conveying sound, that its expressions
                                                  of opinion and its remarks reach,Rome,, put out all
                                                  your power, I beseech you, exert all your energies
                                                  to appear not only to have been worthy of the part
                                                  we played here, but to have surpassed everything
                                                  done there by your high qualities. 
                                                  
      [,15,],And since chance has assigned to me among the
                                                  magistracies the Conduct of public business in the
                                                  city, to you that in a province, if my share is
                                                  inferior to no one's, take care that yours
                                                  surpasses others. At the same time think of this:
                                                  we are not now working for a future and
                                                  prospective glory, but are fighting in defence of
                                                  what has been already gained; which indeed it was
                                                  not so much an object to gain as it is now our
                                                  duty to defend. And if anything in me could be
                                                  apart from you, I should desire nothing more than
                                                  the position which I have already gained. The
                                                  actual fact, however, is that unless all your acts
                                                  and deeds in your province correspond to my
                                                  achievements, I shall think that I have gained
                                                  nothing by those great labours and dangers, in all
                                                  of which you have shared. But if it was you who,
                                                  above all others, assisted me to gain a most
                                                  splendid reputation, you will certainly also
                                                  labour more than others to enable me to retain it.
                                                  You must not be guided by the opinions and
                                                  judgments of the present generation only, but of
                                                  those to come also: and yet the latter will be a
                                                  more candid judgment, for it will not be
                                                  influenced by detraction and malice. Finally, you
                                                  should think of this—that you are not
                                                  seeking glory for yourself alone (and even if that
                                                  were the case, you still ought not to be careless
                                                  of it, especially as you had determined to
                                                  consecrate the memory of your name by the most
                                                  splendid monuments), but you have to share it with
                                                  me, and to hand it down to our children. In regard
                                                  to which you must be on your guard lest by any
                                                  excess of carelessness you should seem not only to
                                                  have neglected your own interests, but to have
                                                  begrudged those of your family also. 
      [,16,],And these observations are not made with the
                                                  idea of any speech of mine appearing to have
                                                  roused you from your sleep, but to have rather
                                                  ""added speed to the runner. For you will continue
                                                  to compel all in the future, as you have compelled
                                                  them in the past, to praise your equity,
                                                  self-control, strictness, and honesty. But from my
                                                  extreme affection I am possessed with a certain
                                                  insatiable greed for glory for you. However, I am
                                                  convinced that, as,Asia,should now be as well-known to
                                                  you as each man's own house is to himself, and
                                                  since to your supreme good sense such great
                                                  experience has now been added, there is nothing
                                                  that affects reputation which you do not know as
                                                  well as possible yourself, and  which
                                                  does not daily occur to your mind without
                                                  anybody's exhortation. But I, who when I read your
                                                  writing seem to hear your voice, and when I write
                                                  to you seem to be talking to you, am therefore
                                                  always best pleased with your longest letter, and
                                                  in writing am often somewhat prolix myself. My
                                                  last prayer and advice to you is that, as good
                                                  poets and painstaking actors always do, so you
                                                  should be most attentive in the last scenes and
                                                  conclusion of your function and business, so that
                                                  this third year of your government, like a third
                                                  act in a play, may appear to have been the most
                                                  elaborated and most highly finished. You will do
                                                  that with more ease if you will think that I, whom
                                                  you always wished to please more than all the

If I were to assert that I am unmoved by grief at Scipio's death, it would be for “wise” men to judge how far I am right, yet, beyond a doubt, my assertion would be false. For I am indeed moved by the loss of a friend such, I believe, as I shall never have again, and—as I can assert on positive knowledge— a friend such as no other man ever was to me. But I am not devoid of a remedy, and I find very great consolation in the comforting fact that I am free from the delusion which causes most men anguish when their friends depart. I believe that no ill has befallen Scipio; it has befallen me, if it has befallen anyone; but great anguish for one's own inconveniences is the mark of the man who loves not his friend but himself.",,"[,10,]
